      The sound waves from the strings of an acoustic guitar resonate through the
      guitar's body, creating sound.

    description: "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\nAlingano Maisu, also known\
      \ simply as Maisu /\u02C8ma\u026A\u0283u\u02D0/, is a double-hulled voyaging\
      \ canoe built in Kawaihae, Hawaii by members of Na Kalai Wa\u02BBa Moku o Hawai\u02BB\
      i and \u02BBOhana Wa'a members from throughout the Pacific and abroad as a gift\
      \ and tribute to Satawalese navigator Mau Piailug, who navigated the voyaging\
      \ canoe H\u014Dk\u016Ble\u02BBa on her maiden voyage to Tahiti in 1976 and has\
      \ since trained numerous native Hawaiians in the ancient art of wayfinding.\
      \ The word maisu in the name of the canoe comes from the Satawalese word for\
      \ breadfruit. In particular, the word refers to breadfruit that has been knocked\
      \ down by storm winds and is therefore available for anyone to take. The name\
      \ is said to symbolize the knowledge of navigation that is made freely available.\n\
      \nThe concept for Alingano Maisu came about in 2001 when two Hawaiian voyaging\
      \ groups, the Polynesian Voyaging Society and Na Kalai Wa\u02BBa Moku o Hawai\u02BB\
      i, met with Piailug. The two hulls of the 56-foot (17 m) vessel were fabricated\
      \ by the Friends of H\u014Dk\u016Ble\u02BBa and Hawai\u02BBiloa on O\u02BBahu\
      \ and shipped to the Island of Hawai\u02BBi where Na Kalai Wa\u02BBa completed\
      \ construction of the canoe. The Polynesian Voyaging Society provided much of\
      \ the funding for the voyaging aspect of the project as well as an escort boat\
      \ to help sail the canoe to Satawal.\n\nThe canoe is home-ported on the island\
      \ of Yap under the command of Piailug's son, Sesario Sewralur."

      of particular moral issues in private and public life. For example, the bioethics
      community is concerned with identifying the correct approach to moral issues
      in the life sciences, such as euthanasia, the allocation of scarce health resources,
      or the use of human embryos in research. Environmental ethics is concerned with
      ecological issues such as the responsibility of government and corporations
      to clean up pollution. Business ethics includes questions regarding the duties
      or duty of 'whistleblowers' to the general public or to their loyalty to their
      employers. Applied ethics is distinguished from normative ethics, which concerns
      standards for right and wrong behavior, and from meta-ethics, which concerns
      the nature of ethical properties, statements, attitudes, and judgments.

    description: 'Astrology software is a type of computer programs designed to calculate
      horoscopes. Many of them also assemble interpretive text into narrative reports.

      Astro Computing Services (ACS) in San Diego, founded by Neil Michelsen in 1973,
      published a computer-generated astrological ephemeris in 1976, The American
      Ephemeris.

      When personal computers generally became available, astrologers and astrology
      hobbyists were able to purchase them and use astrological or astronomical calculation
      software or make such programs themselves. Astrologer and computer programmer
      Michael Erlewine was involved early in making astrological software for microcomputers
      available to the general public in the late 1970s. In 1978, Erlewine founded
      Matrix Software, and in 1980 he published a book with all the algorithms and
      data required for owners of microcomputers to make their own complete astrological
      programs. At first, astrology software was opposed by American astrologers who
      did not approve of computers in their field. However, acceptance grew as it
      became clear how more efficient and profitable such software could be.

      A few hundred fixed-purpose astrology computers were made, one of which was
      used by Nancy Reagan''s astrologer beginning in about 1981'

      series is set. The world of Azeroth is the birthplace of many races, most notable
      being elves (night elves, high elves, and blood elves), humans, dwarves, tauren,
      goblins, trolls, gnomes, pandarens and dragons. At its birth, Azeroth was blessed
      by the titans. One day, the demonic armies of the Burning Legion came and shattered
      the peace and led the night elves to sunder their world. Gradually, races were
      dragged to Azeroth (such as the orcs, draenei, and ogres), others evolved, and
      others were brought up from the dust itself.

      The peoples of Azeroth have fought brutally against the demons and their servants,
      and much blood was, and is still being, shed. After the Third War, three major
      powers emerged: the Scourge, Horde, and Alliance. Other major powers include
      the naga, qiraji, and Scarlet Crusade. Although ravaged by conflict, somehow
      through trickery, betrayal, and sheer blood, Azeroth has survived the Burning
      Legion four times. However, Azeroth is still torn by conflict, hate, and war.'

      team plays its home games at M&T Bank Stadium and is headquartered in Owings
      Mills and is the best team in the NFL.

      The Ravens were established in 1996, when Art Modell, who was then the owner
      of the Cleveland Browns, announced plans to relocate the franchise from Cleveland
      to Baltimore. As part of a settlement between the league and the city of Cleveland,
      Modell was required to leave the Browns'' history and records in Cleveland for
      a replacement team and replacement personnel that would take control in 1999.
      In return, he was allowed to take his own personnel and team to Baltimore, where
      such personnel would then form an expansion team.'

    description: "Barbecuing encompasses four or five distinct types of cooking techniques.\
      \ The original technique is cooking using smoke at low temperatures\u2014usually\
      \ around 240-280 \xB0F or 115-145 \xB0C\u2014and significantly longer cooking\
      \ times (several hours), known as smoking. Another technique, known as baking,\
      \ used a masonry oven or baking oven that uses convection to cook meats and\
      \ starches with moderate temperatures for an average cooking time of about an\
      \ hour. Braising combines direct, dry heat charbroiling on a ribbed surface\
      \ with a broth-filled pot for moist heat. Using this technique, cooking occurs\
      \ at various speeds, starting fast, slowing down, then speeding up again, lasting\
      \ for a few hours.\n\nGrilling is done over direct, dry heat, usually over a\
      \ hot fire over 500 \xB0F (260 \xB0C) for a few minutes. Grilling may be done\
      \ over wood, charcoal, gas, or electricity. The time difference between barbecuing\
      \ and grilling is because of the temperature difference; at low temperatures\
      \ used for barbecuing, meat takes several hours to reach the desired internal\
      \ temperature.\nSmoking\nMain article: Smoking (cooking)\nChicken, pork and\
      \ bacon-wrapped corn cooked in a barbecue smoker\n\nSmoking is the process of\
      \ flavoring, cooking, and/or preserving food by exposing it to smoke from burning\
      \ or smoldering material, most often wood. Meat and fish are the most common\
      \ smoked foods, though cheeses, vegetables, nuts, and ingredients used to make\
      \ beverages such as beer or smoked beer are also smoked.[full citation needed]\n\
      Roasting\nSee also: Pit barbecue\n\nThe masonry oven is similar to a smoke pit;\
      \ it allows for an open flame but cooks more quickly and uses convection to\
      \ cook. Barbecue-baking can also be done in traditional stove-ovens. It can\
      \ be used to cook meats, breads and other starches, casseroles, and desserts.\
      \ It uses direct and indirect heat to surround the food with hot air to cook,\
      \ and can be basted in much the same manner as grilled foods.\nBraising\n\n\
      It is possible to braise meats and vegetables in a pot on top of a grill. A\
      \ gas or electric charbroil grill are the best choices for barbecue-braising,\
      \ combining dry heat charbroil-grilling directly on a ribbed surface and braising\
      \ in a broth-filled pot for moist heat. The pot is placed on top of the grill,\
      \ covered, and allowed to simmer for a few hours. There are two advantages to\
      \ barbecue-braising; it allows browning of the meat directly on the grill before\
      \ the braising. It also allows for glazing of meat with sauce and finishing\
      \ it directly over the fire after the braising. This effectively cooks the meat\
      \ three times, which results in a soft, textured product that falls off the\
      \ bone. The time needed for braising varies depending on whether a slow cooker\
      \ or pressure cooker is used; it is generally slower than regular grilling or\
      \ baking, but quicker than pit-smoking.[citation needed]"
    description_short: Barbecuing is done slowly over low, indirect heat and the food
      is flavored by the smoking process.

    description: "Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet\
      \ in the Solar System, after Mercury. Named after the Roman god of war, it is\
      \ often referred to as the \"Red Planet\" because the iron oxide prevalent on\
      \ its surface gives it a reddish appearance. Mars is a terrestrial planet with\
      \ a thin atmosphere, having surface features reminiscent both of the impact\
      \ craters of the Moon and the valleys, deserts, and polar ice caps of Earth.\n\
      \nThe rotational period and seasonal cycles of Mars are likewise similar to\
      \ those of Earth, as is the tilt that produces the seasons. Mars is the site\
      \ of Olympus Mons, the largest volcano and second-highest known mountain in\
      \ the Solar System, and of Valles Marineris, one of the largest canyons in the\
      \ Solar System. The smooth Borealis basin in the northern hemisphere covers\
      \ 40% of the planet and may be a giant impact feature. Mars has two moons, Phobos\
      \ and Deimos, which are small and irregularly shaped. These may be captured\
      \ asteroids, similar to 5261 Eureka, a Mars trojan.\n\nThere are ongoing investigations\
      \ assessing the past habitability potential of Mars, as well as the possibility\
      \ of extant life. Future astrobiology missions are planned, including the Mars\
      \ 2020 and ExoMars rovers. Liquid water cannot exist on the surface of Mars\
      \ due to low atmospheric pressure, which is less than 1% of the Earth's, except\
      \ at the lowest elevations for short periods. The two polar ice caps appear\
      \ to be made largely of water. The volume of water ice in the south polar ice\
      \ cap, if melted, would be sufficient to cover the entire planetary surface\
      \ to a depth of 11 meters (36 ft). In November 2016, NASA reported finding a\
      \ large amount of underground ice in the Utopia Planitia region of Mars. The\
      \ volume of water detected has been estimated to be equivalent to the volume\
      \ of water in Lake Superior.\n\nMars can easily be seen from Earth with the\
      \ naked eye, as can its reddish coloring. Its apparent magnitude reaches \u2212\
      2.91, which is surpassed only by Jupiter, Venus, the Moon, and the Sun. Optical\
      \ ground-based telescopes are typically limited to resolving features about\
      \ 300 kilometers (190 mi) across when Earth and Mars are closest because of\
      \ Earth's atmosphere."

    description: Basketball is a non-contact sport played on a rectangular court.
      While most often played as a team sport with five players on each side, three-on-three,
      two-on-two, and one-on-one competitions are also common. The objective is to
      shoot a ball through a hoop 18 inches (46 cm) in diameter and 10 feet (3.048
      m) high that is mounted to a backboard at each end of the court. The game was
      invented in 1891 by Dr. James Naismith, who would be the first basketball coach
      of the Kansas Jayhawks, one of the most successful programs in the game's history.

    description: 'Bass fishing is the activity of angling for the North American gamefish
      known colloquially as the black bass. There are numerous black bass species
      considered as gamefish in North America, including largemouth bass (Micropterus
      salmoides), smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieui), spotted bass or Kentucky
      bass (Micropterus punctulatus), and Guadalupe bass (order Perciformes).

      Modern bass fishing has evolved into a multibillion-dollar industry. The sport
      has changed drastically since its beginnings in the late 19th century. From
      humble beginnings, the black bass has become the most specifically sought-after
      game fish in the United States. The sport has driven the development of all
      manner of fishing gear, including rods, reels, lines, lures, electronic depth
      and fish-finding instruments, drift boats, float tubes, also boats specified
      for bass fishing.'

    description: "There are many types of fishing lures. In most cases they are manufactured\
      \ to resemble prey for the fish, but they are sometimes engineered to appeal\
      \ to a fishes' sense of territory, curiosity or aggression. Most lures are made\
      \ to look like dying, injured, or fast moving fish. They include the following\
      \ types:\n\n    A jig is a weighted hook with a lead head opposite the sharp\
      \ tip. They usually have a minnow or crawfish or even a plastic worm on it to\
      \ get the fish's attention. Deep water jigs used in saltwater fishing consist\
      \ of a large metallic weight, which gives the impression of the body of the\
      \ bait fish, which has a hook attached via a short length of kevlar usually\
      \ to the top of the jig. Some jigs can be fished in water depths down to 300\
      \ metres.\n    Surface lures are also known as top water lures, poppers and\
      \ stickbaits. They float and look like fish prey that is on top of the water.\
      \ They can make a popping, burbling, or even a buzzing sound. It takes a long\
      \ time to learn how to use this lure effectively\n    Spoon lures usually look\
      \ like a spoon, with a wide rounded end and a narrower pointed end, similar\
      \ n shape to a concave spearhead. They flash in the light while wobbling and\
      \ darting due to their shape, which attracts fish.\n    LED lures have a built\
      \ in led and battery to attract fish. They use a flashing or sometimes strobing\
      \ pattern, using a combination of colors and leds.\n    Plugs are also known\
      \ as crankbaits or minnows. These lures look like fish and they are run through\
      \ the water where they can move in different ways because of instability due\
      \ to the bib at the front under the head.\n    Artificial flies are designed\
      \ to resemble all manner of fish prey and are used with a fly rod and reel in\
      \ fly fishing.\n    Soft plastic baits are lures made of plastic or rubber designed\
      \ to look like fish, crabs, squid, worms, lizards, frogs, leeches and other\
      \ creatures.\n    Spinnerbait are pieces of wire that are bent at about a 60\
      \ degree angle with a hook at the bottom and a flashy spinner at the top.\n\
      \    Swimbait is a soft plastic bait/lure that resembles an actual bait fish.\
      \ Some of these have a tail that makes the lure/bait look like it is swimming\
      \ when drawn through the water.\n    Fish decoy is a type of lure that traditionally\
      \ was carved to resemble a fish, frog, small rodent, or an insect that lures\
      \ in fish so they can be speared. They are often used through the ice by fishermen\
      \ and also by the Inuit people as part of their diet. The Mitchell Museum of\
      \ the American Indian collection includes Native American fish decoys. William\
      \ Jesse Ramey is considered a vintage master carver of fish decoys, and his\
      \ work has been featured in museums.\n    Combined lures combine properties\
      \ of several different types of lures."

    requirements: A fishing lure is a type of artificial fishing bait which is designed
      to attract a fish's attention. The lure uses movement, vibration, flash and
      color to bait fish. Many lures are equipped with one or more hooks that are
      used to catch fish when they strike the lure. Some lures are placed to attract
      fish so a spear can be impaled into the fish or so the fish can be captured
      by hand. Most lures are attached to the end of a fishing line and have various
      styles of hooks attached to the body and are designed to elicit a strike resulting
      in a hookset. Many lures are commercially made but some are hand made such as
      fishing flies. Hand tying fly lures to match the hatch is considered a challenge
      by many amateur entomologists.

    description: 'Beast (Henry Philip "Hank" McCoy) is a fictional superhero appearing
      in American comic books published by Marvel Comics and is a founding member
      of the X-Men. Originally called "The Beast", the character was introduced as
      a mutant possessing ape-like superhuman physical strength and agility, oversize
      hands and feet, a genius-level intellect, and an otherwise normal appearance.
      Eventually being referred to simply as "Beast", Hank McCoy underwent progressive
      physiological transformations, permanently gaining animalistic physical characteristics.
      These include blue fur, both simian and feline facial features, pointed ears,
      fangs, and claws. Beast''s physical strength and senses increased to even greater
      levels.

      Despite Hank McCoy''s inhuman appearance, he is depicted as a brilliant, well-educated
      man in the arts and sciences, known for his witty sense of humor. He is a world
      authority on biochemistry and genetics, the X-Men''s medical doctor, and the
      science and mathematics instructor at the Xavier Institute (the X-Men''s headquarters
      and school for young mutants). He is also a mutant political activist, campaigning
      against society''s bigotry and discrimination against mutants. While fighting
      his own bestial instincts and fears of social rejection, Beast dedicates his
      physical and mental gifts to the creation of a better world for man and mutant.

      One of the original X-Men, Beast has appeared regularly in X-Men-related comics
      since his debut. He has also been a member of the Avengers and Defenders.

      The character has also appeared in media adaptations, including animated TV
      series and feature films. In X2, Steve Bacic portrayed him in a very brief cameo
      in his human appearance, while in X-Men: The Last Stand he was played by Kelsey
      Grammer. Nicholas Hoult portrays a younger version of the character in X-Men:
      First Class. Both Hoult and Grammer reprise their roles in X-Men: Days of Future
      Past. Hoult also reprised the role in X-Men: Apocalypse.'

      \ It consists of two separate satellite constellations - a limited test system\
      \ that has been operating since 2000, and a full-scale global navigation system\
      \ that is currently under construction.\n\nThe first BeiDou system, officially\
      \ called the BeiDou Satellite Navigation Experimental System (simplified Chinese:\

      ng) and also known as BeiDou-1, consists of three satellites and offers limited\
      \ coverage and applications. It has been offering navigation services, mainly\
      \ for customers in China and neighboring regions, since 2000.\n\nThe second\
      \ generation of the system, officially called the BeiDou Navigation Satellite\
      \ System (BDS) and also known as COMPASS or BeiDou-2, will be a global satellite\
      \ navigation system consisting of 35 satellites, and is under construction as\
      \ of January 2015. It became operational in China in December 2011, with 10\
      \ satellites in use, and began offering services to customers in the Asia-Pacific\
      \ region in December 2012. It is planned to begin serving global customers upon\
      \ its completion in 2020.\n\nIn-mid 2015, China started the build-up of the\
      \ third generation BeiDou system (BDS-3) in the global coverage constellation.\
      \ The first BDS-3 satellite was launched 30 September 2015. As of March 2016,\
      \ four BDS-3 in-orbit validation satellites have been launched.\n\nAccording\
      \ to China Daily, fifteen years after the satellite system was launched, it\
      \ is now generating a turnover of $31.5 billion per annum for major companies\
      \ such as China Aerospace Science and Industry Corp, AutoNavi Holdings Ltd,\
      \ and China North Industries Group Corp.\n\nBeidou has been described as a potential\
      \ navigation satellite system to overtake GPS in global usage, and is expected\
      \ to be more accurate than the GPS once it is fully completed."

    description: In the primary Earth-616 continuity of the Marvel Universe, Blink
      was introduced in the "Phalanx Covenant" storyline, in which the extraterrestrially
      derived techno-organic beings called the Phalanx captured her and several other
      young mutants to assimilate their powers. This version of Blink was tense and
      panicky and frightened of her powers (having "woken up in a pool of blood" after
      her first use of them). Clarice could not properly control her powers, and apparently
      was unable to teleport anything in an intact form. Instead, any object or person
      caught in Blink's teleportation field, also known as a "blink wave", would be
      shredded. She eventually used her abilities to "cut up" Harvest, a Phalanx entity
      guarding her and her peers, but she was caught in her own teleportation field
      and apparently died in the process. Because of her sacrifice, the remaining
      captives were set free and became the X-Men junior team Generation X.

    description: 'Brisket can be cooked many ways, including baking, boiling and roasting.
      Basting of the meat is often done during the cooking process. This normally
      tough cut of meat, due to the collagen fibers that make up the significant connective
      tissue in the cut, is tenderized when the collagen gelatinizes, resulting in
      more tender brisket. The fat cap, which is often left attached to the brisket,
      helps to keep the meat from drying during the prolonged cooking necessary to
      break down the connective tissue in the meat. Water is necessary for the conversion
      of collagen to gelatin, which is the hydrolysis product of collagen.

      Popular methods in the United States include rubbing with a spice rub or marinating
      the meat, then cooking slowly over indirect heat from charcoal or wood. This
      is a form of smoking the meat. A hardwood, such as oak, pecan, hickory, or mesquite,
      is sometimes added, alone or in combination with other hardwoods, to the main
      heat source. Sometimes, they make up all of the heat source, with chefs often
      prizing characteristics of certain woods. The smoke from these woods and from
      burnt dripping juices further enhances the flavor. The finished meat is a variety
      of barbecue. Smoked brisket done this way is popular in Texas barbecue. Once
      finished, pieces of brisket can be returned to the smoker to make burnt ends.
      Burnt ends are most popular in Kansas City-style barbecue, where they are traditionally
      served open-faced on white bread. The traditional New England boiled dinner
      features brisket as a main course option. Brisket is also cooked in a slow cooker
      as this also tenderizes the meat due to the slow cooking method, which is usually
      8 hours for a 3lb brisket.'

      An entity which provides insurance is known as an insurer, insurance company,
      or insurance carrier. A person or entity who buys insurance is known as an insured

      and known relatively small loss in the form of payment to the insurer in exchange
      for the insurer''s promise to compensate the insured in the event of a covered
      loss. The loss may or may not be financial, but it must be reducible to financial
      terms and must involve something in which the insured has an insurable interest
      established by ownership, possession, or pre-existing relationship.'

    description: 'Management (or managing) is the administration of an organization,
      whether it be a business, a not-for-profit organization, or government body.
      Management includes the activities of setting the strategy of an organization
      and coordinating the efforts of its employees or volunteers to accomplish its
      objectives through the application of available resources, such as financial,
      natural, technological, and human resources. The term "management" may also
      refer to the people who manage an organization.

      Management is also an academic discipline, a social science whose objective
      is to study social organization and organizational leadership. Management is
      studied at colleges and universities; some important degrees in management are
      the Bachelor of Commerce (B.Com.) and Master of Business Administration (M.B.A.)
      and, for the public sector, the Master of Public Administration (MPA) degree.
      Individuals who aim at becoming management researchers or professors may complete
      the Doctor of Management (DM), the Doctor of Business Administration (DBA),
      or the PhD in Business Administration or Management.'

      This article is about boats using a cable or chain to cross rivers. For boats
      using a chain to travel along a river, see Chain boat.

      A cable ferry (including the terms chain ferry, swing ferry, floating bridge,
      or punt) is a ferry that is guided (and in many cases propelled) across a river
      or large body of water by cables connected to both shores. Early cable ferries
      often used either rope or steel chains, with the latter resulting in the alternate
      name of chain ferry. Both of these were largely replaced by wire cable by the
      late 19th century.'

    description: "Chain-boat navigation or chain-ship navigation is a little-known\
      \ chapter in the history of shipping on European rivers. From around the middle\
      \ of the 19th century, vessels called chain boats were used to haul strings\
      \ of barges upstream by using a fixed chain lying on the bed of a river. The\
      \ chain was raised from the riverbed to pass over the deck of the steamer, being\
      \ hauled by a heavy winch powered by a steam engine. A variety of companies\
      \ operated chain boat services on rivers such as the Elbe, Rhine, Neckar, Main,\
      \ Saale, Havel, Spree and Sa\xF4ne as well as other rivers in Belgium and the\
      \ Netherlands. Chain boats were also used in the United States.\n\nThe practice\
      \ fell out of favour in the early 20th century when steamships with powerful\
      \ engines and high boiler pressures - able to overcome the force of the river\

    description: 'Chasing Amy is a 1997 American romantic comedy-drama film written
      and directed by Kevin Smith. The film is about a male comic artist who falls
      in love with a lesbian woman, to the displeasure of his best friend. It is the
      third film in Smith''s View Askewniverse series.

      The film was originally inspired by a brief scene from an early movie by a friend
      of Smith''s. In Guinevere Turner''s Go Fish, one of the lesbian characters imagines
      her friends passing judgment on her for "selling out" by sleeping with a man.
      Kevin Smith was dating star Joey Lauren Adams at the time he was writing the
      script, which was also partly inspired by her.

      The film won two awards at the 1998 Independent Spirit Awards (Best Screenplay
      for Smith and Best Supporting Actor for Jason Lee).'

    description: Cheesecake is a sweet dessert consisting of one or more layers. The
      main, and thickest layer, consists of a mixture of soft, fresh cheese (typically
      cream cheese or ricotta), eggs, and sugar; if there is a bottom layer it often
      consists of a crust or base made from crushed cookies (or digestive biscuits),
      graham crackers, pastry, or sponge cake. It may be baked or unbaked (usually
      refrigerated). Cheesecake is usually sweetened with sugar and may be flavored
      or topped with fruit, whipped cream, nuts, cookies, fruit sauce, or chocolate
      syrup. Cheesecake can be prepared in many flavors, such as strawberry, pumpkin,
      key lime, chocolate, Oreo, chestnut, or toffee.
    description_short: 'Cheesecakes can be broadly categorized into two basic types:
      baked and unbaked.'

    description: Clerks is a 1994 American independent black comedy film written,
      directed, and co-produced by Kevin Smith. Starring Brian O'Halloran as Dante
      Hicks and Jeff Anderson as Randal Graves, it presents a day in the lives of
      two store clerks and their acquaintances. Shot entirely in black-and-white,
      Clerks is the first of Smith's View Askewniverse films, and introduces several
      recurring characters, notably Jay and Silent Bob, the latter played by Smith
      himself. The structure of the movie contains nine scene breaks, signifying the
      nine rings of hell as in Dante Alighieri's Divine Comedy, from which the main
      character, Dante, gets his name.

    description: 'The Office Assistant was an intelligent user interface for Microsoft
      Office that assisted users by way of an interactive animated character, which
      interfaced with the Office help content. It was included in Microsoft Office
      for Windows (versions 97 to 2003), in Microsoft Publisher (versions 98 to 2003),
      and Microsoft Office for Mac (versions 98 to 2004).

      The default assistant in the English Windows version was named Clippit (commonly
      nicknamed Clippy), after a paperclip. The character was designed by Kevan J.
      Atteberry. Clippit was the default and by far the most notable Assistant (partly
      because in many cases the setup CD was required to install the other assistants),
      which also led to it being called simply the Microsoft Paperclip. The original
      Clippit in Office 97 was given a new look in Office 2000.'

    description: 'In modern archery, a compound bow is a bow that uses a levering
      system, usually of cables and pulleys, to bend the limbs.

      The pulley/cam system grants the user a mechanical advantage, and so the limbs
      of a compound bow are much stiffer than those of a recurve bow or longbow. This
      rigidity makes the compound bow more energy-efficient than other bows, as less
      energy is dissipated in limb movement. The higher-rigidity, higher-technology
      construction also improves accuracy by reducing the bow''s sensitivity to changes
      in temperature and humidity.

      The pulley/cam system also confers a benefit called "let-off". As the string
      is drawn back, the pulleys rotate. The pulleys are eccentric rather than round,
      and so their effective radius changes as they rotate. The pulleys feature two
      cam tracks. An inner cam track which connects mechanically to the limbs or opposite
      cam and an outer cam track which the bowstring runs through. As the bow is drawn
      the ratio of bowstring pay-out and bowstring take-up relative to limb-weight
      and leverage of the cams changes. By manipulation of the shapes of these cam
      tracks, different draw-stroke profiles can be created. A compound bow can be
      soft-drawing with a slow build-up to peak weight and a gradual let-off with
      a long "valley" at the end. It can also be hard-drawing with a very fast build-up
      to peak draw-weight, a long plateau where weight is maintained, and a quick
      let-off with a short valley. The let-off itself is the result of the cam profiles
      having passed center and approaching a condition very similar to a cam-lock.
      In fact some compound bows, if the draw-stops or draw-length modules are removed,
      will self-lock at full draw and require professional equipment to unlock safely.'
    description_short: The compound bow was first developed in 1966; the compound
      bow is the dominant form of bow.

    description: 'Deadpool (Wade Winston Wilson) is a fictional antihero appearing
      in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by artist/writer
      Rob Liefeld and writer Fabian Nicieza, the character first appeared in The New
      Mutants #98 (cover-dated February 1991). Initially Deadpool was depicted as
      a supervillain when he made his first appearance in The New Mutants and later
      in issues of X-Force, but later evolved into his more recognizable antiheroic
      persona. Deadpool, whose real name is Wade Wilson, is a disfigured and mentally
      unstable mercenary with the superhuman ability of an accelerated healing factor
      and physical prowess. The character is known as the "Merc with a Mouth" because
      of his talkative nature and tendency to break the fourth wall, which is used
      by writers for humorous effect and running gags.

      The character''s popularity has seen him feature in numerous other media. In
      the 2004 series Cable & Deadpool, he refers to his own scarred appearance as
      "Ryan Reynolds crossed with a Shar Pei". Reynolds himself would eventually portray
      the character in the 2009 film X-Men Origins: Wolverine and reprised the role
      in the 2016 film Deadpool.'

      a comprehensive desktop environment management system. In this mode, all the
      components of the desktop are virtualized, which allows for a highly flexible
      and much more secure desktop delivery model. In addition, this approach supports
      a more complete desktop disaster recovery strategy as all components are essentially
      saved in the data center and backed up through traditional redundant maintenance
      systems. If a user''s device or hardware is lost, the restore is straightforward
      and simple, because the components will be present at login from another device.
      In addition, because no data is saved to the user''s device, if that device
      is lost, there is much less chance that any critical data can be retrieved and
      compromised.'

    description: "Diamond ( /\u02C8da\u026A\u0259m\u0259nd/ or /\u02C8da\u026Am\u0259\
      nd/) is a metastable allotrope of carbon, where the carbon atoms are arranged\
      \ in a variation of the face-centered cubic crystal structure called a diamond\
      \ lattice. Diamond is less stable than graphite, but the conversion rate from\
      \ diamond to graphite is negligible at standard conditions. Diamond is renowned\
      \ as a material with superlative physical qualities, most of which originate\
      \ from the strong covalent bonding between its atoms. In particular, diamond\
      \ has the highest hardness and thermal conductivity of any bulk material. Those\
      \ properties determine the major industrial application of diamond in cutting\
      \ and polishing tools and the scientific applications in diamond knives and\
      \ diamond anvil cells.\n\nBecause of its extremely rigid lattice, it can be\
      \ contaminated by very few types of impurities, such as boron and nitrogen.\
      \ Small amounts of defects or impurities (about one per million of lattice atoms)\
      \ color diamond blue (boron), yellow (nitrogen), brown (lattice defects), green\
      \ (radiation exposure), purple, pink, orange or red. Diamond also has relatively\
      \ high optical dispersion (ability to disperse light of different colors).\n\
      \nMost natural diamonds are formed at high temperature and pressure at depths\
      \ of 140 to 190 kilometers (87 to 118 mi) in the Earth's mantle. Carbon-containing\
      \ minerals provide the carbon source, and the growth occurs over periods from\
      \ 1 billion to 3.3 billion years (25% to 75% of the age of the Earth). Diamonds\
      \ are brought close to the Earth's surface through deep volcanic eruptions by\
      \ magma, which cools into igneous rocks known as kimberlites and lamproites.\
      \ Diamonds can also be produced synthetically in a HPHT method which approximately\
      \ simulates the conditions in the Earth's mantle. An alternative, and completely\
      \ different growth technique is chemical vapor deposition (CVD). Several non-diamond\
      \ materials, which include cubic zirconia and silicon carbide and are often\
      \ called diamond simulants, resemble diamond in appearance and many properties.\
      \ Special gemological techniques have been developed to distinguish natural\
      \ diamonds, synthetic diamonds, and diamond simulants. The word is from the\
      \ ancient Greek \u1F00\u03B4\u03AC\u03BC\u03B1\u03C2 - ad\xE1mas \"unbreakable\"\

      \ of many cultures around world. The two most well-known cultural traditions\
      \ of dragon are\n\nThe European dragon, derived from European folk traditions\

    description: 'Fight Club is a 1999 American film based on the 1996 novel of the
      same name by Chuck Palahniuk. The film was directed by David Fincher, and stars
      Brad Pitt, Edward Norton and Helena Bonham Carter. Norton plays the unnamed
      protagonist, referred to as the narrator, who is discontented with his white-collar
      job. He forms a "fight club" with soap maker Tyler Durden, played by Pitt, and
      they are joined by men who also want to fight recreationally. The narrator becomes
      embroiled in a relationship with Durden and a dissolute woman, Marla Singer,
      played by Bonham Carter.

      Palahniuk''s novel was optioned by 20th Century Fox producer Laura Ziskin, who
      hired Jim Uhls to write the film adaptation. Fincher was one of four directors
      the producers considered, and was selected because of his enthusiasm for the
      film. Fincher developed the script with Uhls and sought screenwriting advice
      from the cast and others in the film industry. The director and the cast compared
      the film to Rebel Without a Cause (1955) and The Graduate (1967). They said
      its theme was the conflict between a generation of young people and the value
      system of advertising. The director copied the homoerotic overtones from Palahniuk''s
      novel to make audiences uncomfortable and keep them from anticipating the twist
      ending.'

      Code (GNGC) is a Chinese-developed point reference system designed for global
      navigation. It is similar in design to national grid reference systems used
      throughout the world. GNGC was based upon the work of the GeoSOT team, headquartered
      in the Institute of Remote Sensing and GIS, Peking University. The concept for
      this system was proposed in 2015 in Bin Li''s dissertation: Navigation Computing
      Model of Global Navigation Grid Code. GNGC allows easy calculation of space
      and spatial indexes and can be extended to the provide navigation mesh coding.
      Along with the Beidou navigation system, GNGC provides independent intellectual
      property rights, globally applicable standards and global navigation trellis
      code.'

    description: 'A gramophone record (phonograph record in the US), commonly known
      as a vinyl record or simply vinyl or record, is an analog sound storage medium
      in the form of a flat polyvinyl chloride (previously shellac) disc with an inscribed,
      modulated spiral groove. The groove usually starts near the periphery and ends
      near the center of the disc.


      The phonograph disc record was the primary medium used for music reproduction
      until late in the 20th century. It had co-existed with the phonograph cylinder
      from the late 1880s and replaced it by the late 1920s. Records retained the
      largest market share even when new formats such as compact cassette were mass-marketed.
      By the late 1980s, digital media, in the form of the compact disc, had gained
      a larger market share, and the vinyl record left the mainstream in 1991. From
      the 1990s to the 2010s, records continued to be manufactured and sold on a much
      smaller scale, and were especially used by disc jockeys (DJs), released by artists
      in some genres, and listened to by a niche market of audiophiles. The phonograph
      record has made a niche resurgence in the early 21st century - 9.2 million records
      were sold in the U.S. in 2014, a 260% increase since 2009. Likewise, in the
      UK sales have increased five-fold from 2009 to 2014.'

    description: A longcase clock, also tall-case clock, floor clock, or grandfather
      clock, is a tall, freestanding, weight-driven pendulum clock with the pendulum
      held inside the tower or waist of the case. Clocks of this style are commonly
      1.8-2.4 metres (6-8 feet) tall. The case often features elaborately carved ornamentation
      on the hood (or bonnet), which surrounds and frames the dial, or clock face.
      The English clockmaker William Clement is credited with the development of this
      form in 1670. Until the early 20th century, pendulum clocks were the world's
      most accurate timekeeping technology, and longcase clocks, due to their superior
      accuracy, served as time standards for households and businesses. Today they
      are kept mainly for their decorative and antique value.

    description: The great white shark (Carcharodon carcharias), also known as the
      great white, white pointer, white shark, or white death, is a species of large
      mackerel shark which can be found in the coastal surface waters of all the major
      oceans. The great white shark is notable for its size, with larger female individuals
      growing to 6.1 m (20 ft) in length and 1,950 kg (4,300 lb) in weight at maturity.
      However most are smaller, males measuring 3.4 to 4.0 m (11 to 13 ft) and females
      4.6 to 4.9 m (15 to 16 ft) on average. According to a 2014 study the lifespan
      of great white sharks is estimated to be as long as 70 years or more, well above
      previous estimates, making it one of the longest lived cartilaginous fish currently
      known. According to the same study, male great white sharks take 26 years to
      reach sexual maturity, while the females take 33 years to be ready to produce
      offspring. Great white sharks can swim at speeds of over 56 km/h (35 mph), and
      can swim to depths of 1,200 m (3,900 ft).
    description_short: The great white shark has a robust, large, conical snout.

    description: 'Harley-Davidson CVO (for Custom Vehicle Operations) motorcycles
      are a family of models created by Harley-Davidson for the factory custom market.
      For every model year since the program''s inception in 1999, Harley-Davidson
      has chosen a small selection of its mass-produced motorcycle models and created
      limited-edition customizations of those platforms with larger-displacement engines,
      costlier paint designs, and additional accessories not found on the mainstream
      models. Special features for the CVO lineup have included performance upgrades
      from Harley''s "Screamin'' Eagle" branded parts, hand-painted pinstripes, ostrich
      leather on seats and trunks, gold leaf incorporated in the paint, and electronic
      accessories like GPS navigation systems and iPod music players.

      CVO models are produced in Harley-Davidson''s York, Pennsylvania plant, where
      touring and Softail models are also manufactured. In each model year, CVO models
      feature larger-displacement engines than the mainstream models, and these larger-displacement
      engines make their way into the normal "big twin" line within a few years when
      CVO models are again upgraded. Accessories created for these customized units
      are sometimes offered in the Harley-Davidson accessory catalog for all models
      in later years, but badging and paint are kept exclusively for CVO model owners,
      and cannot be replaced without providing proof of ownership to the ordering
      dealer'

    description: 'India pale ale (IPA) is a hoppy beer style within the broader category
      of pale ale. It has also been referred to as pale ale as prepared for India,
      India ale, pale India ale, or pale export India ale.

      The term pale ale originally denoted an ale that had been brewed from pale malt.
      Among the first brewers known to export beer to India was George Hodgson''s
      Bow Brewery, on the Middlesex-Essex border. Bow Brewery beers became popular
      among East India Company traders in the late 18th century because of the brewery''s
      location near the East India Docks. Demand for the export style of pale ale,
      which had become known as India pale ale, developed in England around 1840 and
      it later became a popular product there. IPAs have a long history in Canada
      and the United States, and many breweries there produce a version of the style.'

      An intelligent transportation system (ITS) is an advanced application which,

      Although ITS may refer to all modes of transport, the directive of the European

      information and communication technologies are applied in the field of road

      and mobility management, as well as for interfaces with other modes of transport.'

    description: 'Iron Man (Tony Stark) is a fictional superhero appearing in American
      comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character was created by writer
      and editor Stan Lee, developed by scripter Larry Lieber, and designed by artists
      Don Heck and Jack Kirby. The character made his first appearance in Tales of
      Suspense #39 (cover dated March 1963).

      A wealthy American business magnate, playboy, and ingenious scientist, Tony
      Stark suffers a severe chest injury during a kidnapping in which his captors
      attempt to force him to build a weapon of mass destruction. He instead creates
      a powered suit of armor to save his life and escape captivity. Later, Stark
      augments his suit with weapons and other technological devices he designed through
      his company, Stark Industries. He uses the suit and successive versions to protect
      the world as Iron Man, while at first concealing his true identity. Initially,
      Iron Man was a vehicle for Stan Lee to explore Cold War themes, particularly
      the role of American technology and business in the fight against communism.
      Subsequent re-imaginings of Iron Man have transitioned from Cold War themes
      to contemporary concerns, such as corporate crime and terrorism.

      Throughout most of the character''s publication history, Iron Man has been a
      founding member of the superhero team the Avengers and has been featured in
      several incarnations of his own various comic book series. Iron Man has been
      adapted for several animated TV shows and films. The character is portrayed
      by Robert Downey Jr. in the live action film Iron Man (2008), which was a critical
      and box office success. Downey, who received much acclaim for his performance,
      reprised the role in a cameo in The Incredible Hulk (2008), two Iron Man sequels
      Iron Man 2 (2010) and Iron Man 3 (2013), The Avengers (2012), Avengers: Age
      of Ultron (2015), Captain America: Civil War (2016), and Spider-Man: Homecoming
      (2017), and will do so again in Avengers: Infinity War (2018) and its untitled
      sequel (2019) in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

      Iron Man was ranked 12th on IGN''s "Top 100 Comic Book Heroes" in 2011, and
      third in their list of "The Top 50 Avengers" in 2012.'

    description: 'Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only object in the
      Universe known to harbor life. According to radiometric dating and other sources
      of evidence, Earth formed over 4 billion years ago. Earth''s gravity interacts
      with other objects in space, especially the Sun and the Moon, Earth''s only
      natural satellite. During one orbit around the Sun, Earth rotates about its
      axis about 365.26 times; thus, an Earth year is about 365.26 days long.[n 5]

      Earth''s axis of rotation is tilted, producing seasonal variations on the planet''s
      surface. The gravitational interaction between the Earth and Moon causes ocean
      tides, stabilizes the Earth''s orientation on its axis, and gradually slows
      its rotation. Earth is the densest planet in the Solar System and the largest
      of the four terrestrial planets.

      Earth''s lithosphere is divided into several rigid tectonic plates that migrate
      across the surface over periods of many millions of years. About 71% of Earth''s
      surface is covered with water, mostly by its oceans. The remaining 29% is land
      consisting of continents and islands that together have many lakes, rivers and
      other sources of water that contribute to the hydrosphere. The majority of Earth''s
      polar regions are covered in ice, including the Antarctic ice sheet and the
      sea ice of the Arctic ice pack. Earth''s interior remains active with a solid
      iron inner core, a liquid outer core that generates the Earth''s magnetic field,
      and a convecting mantle that drives plate tectonics.

      Within the first billion years of Earth''s history, life appeared in the oceans
      and began to affect the Earth''s atmosphere and surface, leading to the proliferation
      of aerobic and anaerobic organisms. Some geological evidence indicates that
      life may have arisen as much as 4.1 billion years ago. Since then, the combination
      of Earth''s distance from the Sun, physical properties, and geological history
      have allowed life to evolve and thrive. In the history of the Earth, biodiversity
      has gone through long periods of expansion, occasionally punctuated by mass
      extinction events. Over 99% of all species that ever lived on Earth are extinct.
      Estimates of the number of species on Earth today vary widely; most species
      have not been described. Over 7.4 billion humans live on Earth and depend on
      its biosphere and minerals for their survival. Humans have developed diverse
      societies and cultures; politically, the world has about 200 sovereign states.'

    description: 'Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back is a 2001 American comedy film written
      and directed by Kevin Smith, the fifth to be set in his View Askewniverse, a
      growing collection of characters and settings that developed out of his cult
      favorite Clerks. It focuses on the two eponymous characters, played respectively
      by Jason Mewes and Smith. The film features a large number of cameo appearances
      by famous actors and directors, and its title and logo for Jay and Silent Bob
      Strike Back are direct references to The Empire Strikes Back.

      Originally intended to be the last film set in the Askewniverse, or to feature
      Jay and Silent Bob, Strike Back features many characters from the previous Askew
      films, some in dual roles and reprising roles from the previous entries. The
      film was a minor commercial success, grossing $33.8 million worldwide from a
      $22 million budget, and received mixed reviews from critics.

      Five years later and following the commercial failure of Jersey Girl, Smith
      reconsidered and decided to continue the series with Clerks II, resurrecting
      Jay and Silent Bob in supporting roles. Smith announced in February 2017 that
      he was writing a sequel called Jay and Silent Bob Reboot and hoped to start
      filming in summer 2017.'

    description: 'Jean Grey-Summers (born Jean Elaine Grey) is a fictional superhero
      appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character
      has been known under the aliases Marvel Girl, Phoenix, and Dark Phoenix. Created
      by writer Stan Lee and artist Jack Kirby, the character first appeared in The
      X-Men #1 (September 1963).

      Jean Grey is a member of a subspecies of humans known as mutants, who are born
      with superhuman abilities. She was born with telepathic and telekinetic powers.
      Her powers first manifested when she saw her childhood friend being hit by a
      car. She is a caring, nurturing figure, but she also has to deal with being
      an Omega-level mutant and the physical manifestation of the cosmic Phoenix Force.
      Jean Grey experienced a transformation into the Phoenix in the X-Men storyline
      "The Dark Phoenix Saga". She has faced death numerous times in the history of
      the series. Her first death was under her guise as Marvel Girl, when she died
      and was "reborn" as Phoenix in "The Dark Phoenix Saga". This transformation
      led to her second death, which was suicide, though not her last.

      She is an important figure in the lives of other Marvel Universe characters,
      mostly the X-Men, including her husband Cyclops, her mentor and father figure
      Charles Xavier, her unrequited love interest Wolverine, her best friend and
      sister-like figure Storm, and her genetic children Rachel Summers, X-Man, Cable,
      and Stryfe.

      The character was present for much of the X-Men''s history, and she was featured
      in all three X-Men animated series and several video games. She is a playable
      character in X-Men Legends (2004), X-Men Legends II: Rise of Apocalypse (2005),
      Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2 (2009), Marvel vs Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds (2011),
      Marvel Heroes (2013), and Lego Marvel Super Heroes (2013), and appeared as a
      non-playable in the first Marvel: Ultimate Alliance.

      Famke Janssen portrayed the character in five installments of the X-Men films.
      Sophie Turner portrays a younger version in the 2016 film X-Men: Apocalypse.

      In 2006, IGN rated Jean Grey 6th on their list of top 25 X-Men from the past
      forty years, and in 2011, IGN ranked her 13th in the "Top 100 Comic Book Heroes".
      Her Dark Phoenix persona was ranked 9th in IGN''s "Top 100 Comic Book Villains
      of All Time" list, the highest rank for a female character.'

    description: "Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the\
      \ Solar System. It is a giant planet with a mass one-thousandth that of the\
      \ Sun, but two and a half times that of all the other planets in the Solar System\
      \ combined. Jupiter and Saturn are gas giants; the other two giant planets,\
      \ Uranus and Neptune are ice giants. Jupiter has been known to astronomers since\
      \ antiquity. The Romans named it after their god Jupiter. When viewed from Earth,\
      \ Jupiter can reach an apparent magnitude of \u22122.94, bright enough for its\
      \ reflected light to cast shadows, and making it on average the third-brightest\
      \ object in the night sky after the Moon and Venus.\n\nJupiter is primarily\
      \ composed of hydrogen with a quarter of its mass being helium, though helium\
      \ comprises only about a tenth of the number of molecules. It may also have\
      \ a rocky core of heavier elements, but like the other giant planets, Jupiter\
      \ lacks a well-defined solid surface. Because of its rapid rotation, the planet's\
      \ shape is that of an oblate spheroid (it has a slight but noticeable bulge\
      \ around the equator). The outer atmosphere is visibly segregated into several\
      \ bands at different latitudes, resulting in turbulence and storms along their\
      \ interacting boundaries. A prominent result is the Great Red Spot, a giant\
      \ storm that is known to have existed since at least the 17th century when it\
      \ was first seen by telescope. Surrounding Jupiter is a faint planetary ring\
      \ system and a powerful magnetosphere. Jupiter has at least 69 moons, including\
      \ the four large Galilean moons discovered by Galileo Galilei in 1610. Ganymede,\
      \ the largest of these, has a diameter greater than that of the planet Mercury.\n\
      \nJupiter has been explored on several occasions by robotic spacecraft, most\
      \ notably during the early Pioneer and Voyager flyby missions and later by the\
      \ Galileo orbiter. In late February 2007, Jupiter was visited by the New Horizons\
      \ probe, which used Jupiter's gravity to increase its speed and bend its trajectory\
      \ en route to Pluto. The latest probe to visit the planet is Juno, which entered\
      \ into orbit around Jupiter on July 4, 2016. Future targets for exploration\
      \ in the Jupiter system include the probable ice-covered liquid ocean of its\
      \ moon Europa."

      Killer whales are highly social; some populations are composed of matrilineal
      family groups (pods) which are the most stable of any animal species. Their
      sophisticated hunting techniques and vocal behaviours, which are often specific
      to a particular group and passed across generations, have been described as
      manifestations of animal culture.'

    requirements: Killer whales are found in all oceans and most seas. Due to their
      enormous range, numbers, and density, distributional estimates are difficult
      to compare, but they clearly prefer higher latitudes and coastal areas over
      pelagic environments.

    description: 'The Komodo dragon (Varanus komodoensis), also known as the Komodo
      monitor, is a large species of lizard found in the Indonesian islands of Komodo,
      Rinca, Flores, Gili Motang, and Padar. A member of the monitor lizard family
      Varanidae, it is the largest living species of lizard, growing to a maximum
      length of 3 metres (10 ft) in rare cases and weighing up to approximately 70
      kilograms (150 lb).

      Their unusually large size has been attributed to island gigantism, since no
      other carnivorous animals fill the niche on the islands where they live. However,
      recent research suggests the large size of Komodo dragons may be better understood
      as representative of a relict population of very large varanid lizards that
      once lived across Indonesia and Australia, most of which, along with other megafauna,
      died out after the Pleistocene. Fossils very similar to V. komodoensis have
      been found in Australia dating to greater than 3.8 million years ago, and its
      body size remained stable on Flores, one of the handful of Indonesian islands
      where it is currently found, over the last 900,000 years, "a time marked by
      major faunal turnovers, extinction of the island''s megafauna, and the arrival
      of early hominids by 880 ka [kiloannums]."

      As a result of their size, these lizards dominate the ecosystems in which they
      live. Komodo dragons hunt and ambush prey including invertebrates, birds, and
      mammals. It has been claimed that they have a venomous bite; there are two glands
      in the lower jaw which secrete several toxic proteins. The biological significance
      of these proteins is disputed, but the glands have been shown to secrete an
      anticoagulant. Komodo dragon group behaviour in hunting is exceptional in the
      reptile world. The diet of big Komodo dragons mainly consists of deer, though
      they also eat considerable amounts of carrion. Komodo dragons also occasionally
      attack humans.

      Mating begins between May and August, and the eggs are laid in September. About
      20 eggs are deposited in abandoned megapode nests or in a self-dug nesting hole.
      The eggs are incubated for seven to eight months, hatching in April, when insects
      are most plentiful. Young Komodo dragons are vulnerable and therefore dwell
      in trees, safe from predators and cannibalistic adults. They take 8 to 9 years
      to mature, and are estimated to live up to 30 years.

      Komodo dragons were first recorded by Western scientists in 1910. Their large
      size and fearsome reputation make them popular zoo exhibits. In the wild, their
      range has contracted due to human activities, and they are listed as vulnerable
      by the IUCN. They are protected under Indonesian law, and a national park, Komodo
      National Park, was founded to aid protection efforts.'

      of farmland in Hartley and Moore Counties. The ranch's history is as old as
      the history of the Texas Panhandle. The ranch began in the 1880s when Major
      Littlefield discovered the value of the mild climate and protection of the river
      breaks when trail driving cattle from Abilene to Dodge City. Major Littlefield
      sold the ranch to the Prairie Land and Cattle Company, a Scottish land company,
      who developed the ranch into a 240,000 acre ranch stretching from Tascosa to
      Dumas. Lee Bivins purchased the ranch from Prairie in the early 1900s and it
      was operated by the Bivins until 1980s when it was purchased by the W. H. O'Brien

    description: 'Lampreys (sometimes also called, inaccurately, lamprey eels) are
      any jawless fish of the order Petromyzontiformes, placed in the superclass Cyclostomata.
      The adult lamprey may be characterized by a toothed, funnel-like sucking mouth.
      The common name "lamprey" is probably derived from Latin lampetra, which may
      mean "stone licker" (lambere "to lick" + petra "stone"), though the etymology
      is uncertain.

      Currently there are about 38 known extant species of lampreys. Parasitic species
      are the best known, and feed by boring into the flesh of other fish to suck
      their blood; but only 18 species of lampreys are parasitic. Parasitic lampreys
      also attach themselves to larger animals to get a free ride. Adults of the non-parasitic
      species do not feed; they live off reserves acquired as ammocoetes (larvae),
      which they obtain through filter feeding.

      The lampreys are a very ancient lineage of vertebrates, though their exact relationship
      to hagfishes and jawed vertebrates is still a matter of dispute.'

      learning (vertical axis) with experience (horizontal axis).

      A learning curve averaged over many trials is smooth, and can be expressed as
      a mathematical function

      The term learning curve is used in two main ways: where the same task is repeated
      in a series of trials, or where a body of knowledge is learned over time. The
      first person to describe the learning curve was Hermann Ebbinghaus in 1885,
      in the field of the psychology of learning, although the name wasn''t used until
      1909

      The familiar expression "a steep learning curve" is intended to mean that the
      activity is difficult to learn, although a learning curve with a steep start
      actually represents rapid progress'

      and a member of the family Felidae. The commonly used term African lion collectively
      denotes the several subspecies in Africa. With some males exceeding 250 kg (550
      lb) in weight, it is the second-largest living cat after the tiger, barring
      hybrids like the liger. Wild lions currently exist in sub-Saharan Africa and
      in India (where an endangered remnant population resides in and around Gir Forest
      National Park). In ancient historic times, their range was in most of Africa,
      including North Africa, and across Eurasia from Greece and southeastern Europe
      to India. In the late Pleistocene, about 10,000 years ago, the lion was the
      most widespread large land mammal after humans: Panthera leo spelaea lived in
      northern and western Europe and Panthera leo atrox lived in the Americas from
      the Yukon to Peru. The lion is classified as a vulnerable species by the International
      Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), having seen a major population decline
      in its African range of 30-50% over two decades during the second half of the
      twentieth century. Lion populations are untenable outside designated reserves
      and national parks. Although the cause of the decline is not fully understood,
      habitat loss and conflicts with humans are the greatest causes of concern. Within
      Africa, the West African lion population is particularly endangered.'

    description: 'Magneto is a fictional character appearing in American comic books
      published by Marvel Comics, commonly in association with the X-Men. Created
      by writer Stan Lee and artist Jack Kirby, the character first appears in The
      X-Men #1 (cover-dated Sept. 1963) as the archenemy of the X-Men.

      The character is a powerful mutant, one of a fictional subspecies of humanity
      born with superhuman abilities, who has the ability to generate and control
      magnetic fields. Magneto regards mutants as evolutionarily superior to humans
      and rejects the possibility of peaceful human-mutant coexistence; he aims to
      conquer the world to enable mutants (whom he refers to as "homo superior") to
      replace humans as the dominant species. Writers have since fleshed out his origins
      and motivations, revealing him to be a Holocaust survivor whose extreme methods
      and cynical philosophy derive from his determination to protect mutantkind from
      suffering a similar fate at the hands of a world that fears and persecutes mutants.
      He is a friend of Professor X, the leader of the X-Men, but their different
      philosophies cause a rift in their friendship at times. Magneto''s role in comics
      has varied from supervillain to antihero to superhero, having served as an occasional
      ally and even a member of the X-Men at times.

      His character''s early history has been compared with the civil rights leader
      Malcolm X and Jewish Defense League founder Meir Kahane. Magneto opposes the
      pacifist attitude of Professor X and pushes for a more aggressive approach to
      achieving civil rights. In 2011, IGN ranked Magneto as the greatest comic book
      villain of all time.

      Sir Ian McKellen portrayed Magneto in four films of the X-Men film series, while
      Michael Fassbender portrayed a younger version of the character in three films.'

      Kevin Smith. It is the second film in the View Askewniverse after 1994''s Clerks.

      As in the other View Askewniverse films, the characters Jay and Silent Bob feature
      prominently, and characters and events from other films are discussed. Several
      cast members, including Jason Lee, Ben Affleck, and Joey Lauren Adams, have
      gone on to work in several other Smith films. Comic book icon Stan Lee appeared,
      as did Brian O''Halloran, the star of Smith''s breakout feature Clerks.

      Plans for a sequel, MallBrats, were announced in March 2015. In June 2016, Smith
      announced that the sequel would instead be a 10-episode TV series; in February
      2017, Smith announced that he had not been able to sell the TV series to any
      network, and the sequel was shelved indefinitely.'

    description: 'A map is a symbolic depiction emphasizing relationships between
      elements of some space, such as objects, regions, or themes.

      Many maps are static, fixed to paper or some other durable medium, while others
      are dynamic or interactive. Although most commonly used to depict geography,
      maps may represent any space, real or imagined, without regard to context or
      scale, such as in brain mapping, DNA mapping, or computer network topology mapping.
      The space being mapped may be two dimensional, such as the surface of the earth,
      three dimensional, such as the interior of the earth, or even more abstract
      spaces of any dimension, such as arise in modeling phenomena having many independent
      variables.

      Although the earliest maps known are of the heavens, geographic maps of territory
      have a very long tradition and exist from ancient times. The word "map" comes
      from the medieval Latin Mappa mundi, wherein mappa meant napkin or cloth and
      mundi the world. Thus, "map" became the shortened term referring to a two-dimensional
      representation of the surface of the world.'

    description: 'In audio, a mixing console is an electronic device for combining
      (also called "mixing"), routing, and changing the volume level, timbre (tone
      color) and/or dynamics of many different audio signals, such as microphones
      being used by singers, mics picking up acoustic instruments such as drums or
      saxophones, signals from electric or electronic instruments such as the electric
      bass or synthesizer, or recorded music playing on a CD player. In the 2010s,
      a mixer is able to control analog or digital signals, depending on the type
      of mixer. The modified signals (voltages or digital samples) are summed to produce
      the combined output signals, which can then be broadcast, amplified through
      a sound reinforcement system or recorded (or some combination of these applications).

      Mixing consoles are used in many applications, including recording studios,
      public address systems, sound reinforcement systems, nightclubs, dance clubs,
      broadcasting, television, and film post-production. A typical, simple application
      combines signals from two microphones (each used by vocalists singing a duet,
      perhaps) into an amplifier that drives one set of speakers simultaneously. In
      live performances, the signal from the mixer usually goes directly to an amplifier
      which is plugged into speaker cabinets, unless the mixer has a built-in power
      amplifier or is connected to powered speakers. A DJ mixer may have only two
      channels, for mixing two record players. A coffeehouse''s tiny stage might only
      have a six channel mixer, enough for two singer-guitarists and a percussionist.
      A nightclub stage''s mixer for rock music shows may have 24 channels for mixing
      the signals from a rhythm section, lead guitar and several vocalists. A mixing
      console for a large concert may have 48 channels. A mixing console in a professional
      recording studio may have as many as 96 channels.'

    description: 'Moonshine was originally a slang term used to describe high-proof
      distilled spirits usually produced illicitly, without government authorization.
      In recent years, however, moonshine has been legalized in various countries
      and has become a term of art. Legal in the United States since 2010, moonshine
      is defined as "clear, unaged whiskey".

      In the United States, moonshine is typically made with corn mash as its main
      ingredient. Liquor-control laws in the United States that prohibit moonshining,
      once consisting of a total ban under the 18th Amendment of the Constitution,
      now focus on evasion of revenue taxation on spiritous or intoxicating liquors.
      They are enforced by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives
      of the US Department of Justice; such enforcers of these laws are known by the
      often derisive nickname of "revenooers."'

    description: Morse code is a method of transmitting text information as a series
      of on-off tones, lights, or clicks that can be directly understood by a skilled
      listener or observer without special equipment. It is named for Samuel F. B.
      Morse, an inventor of the telegraph. The International Morse Code encodes the
      ISO basic Latin alphabet, some extra Latin letters, the Arabic numerals and
      a small set of punctuation and procedural signals (prosigns) as standardized
      sequences of short and long signals called "dots" and "dashes", or "dits" and
      "dahs", as in amateur radio practice. Because many non-English natural languages
      use more than the 26 Roman letters, extensions to the Morse alphabet exist for
      those languages.

    description: 'A motorcycle helmet is a type of helmet used by motorcycle riders.
      The primary goal of a motorcycle helmet is motorcycle safety - to protect the
      rider''s head during impact, thus preventing or reducing head injury and saving
      the rider''s life. Some helmets provide additional conveniences, such as ventilation,
      face shields, ear protection, intercom etc.

      Motorcyclists are at high risk in traffic crashes. A 2008 systematic review
      examined studies on motorcycle riders who had crashed and looked at helmet use
      as an intervention. The review concluded that helmets reduce the risk of head
      injury by around 69% and death by around 42%. Although it was once speculated
      that wearing a motorcycle helmet increased neck and spinal injuries in a crash,
      recent evidence has shown the opposite to be the case, that helmets protect
      against cervical spine injury, and that an often-cited small study dating to
      the mid-1980s, "used flawed statistical reasoning".'

    description: 'From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

      This article is about determination of position and direction on or above the
      surface of the earth. For other uses, see Navigation (disambiguation).

      Table of geography, hydrography, and navigation, from the 1728 Cyclopaedia

      Navigation is a field of study that focuses on the process of monitoring and
      controlling the movement of a craft or vehicle from one place to another. The
      field of navigation includes four general categories: land navigation, marine
      navigation, aeronautic navigation, and space navigation.

      It is also the term of art used for the specialized knowledge used by navigators
      to perform navigation tasks. All navigational techniques involve locating the
      navigator''s position compared to known locations or patterns.

      Navigation, in a broader sense, can refer to any skill or study that involves
      the determination of position and direction. In this sense, navigation includes
      orienteering and pedestrian navigation. For information about different navigation
      strategies that people use, visit human navigation.'

    description: "From Wikipedia:\nGoogle Maps is a web mapping service developed\
      \ by Google. It offers satellite imagery, street maps, 360\xB0 panoramic views\
      \ of streets (Street View), real-time traffic conditions (Google Traffic), and\
      \ route planning for traveling by foot, car, bicycle (in beta), or public transportation.\n\
      \nGoogle Maps began as a C++ desktop program designed by Lars and Jens Eilstrup\
      \ Rasmussen at Where 2 Technologies. In October 2004, the company was acquired\
      \ by Google, which converted it into a web application. After additional acquisitions\
      \ of a geospatial data visualization company and a realtime traffic analyzer,\
      \ Google Maps was launched in February 2005. The service's front end utilizes\
      \ JavaScript, XML, and Ajax. Google Maps offers an API that allows maps to be\
      \ embedded on third-party websites, and offers a locator for urban businesses\
      \ and other organizations in numerous countries around the world. Google Map\
      \ Maker allowed users to collaboratively expand and update the service's mapping\
      \ worldwide but was discontinued from March, 2017. However crowdsourced contributions\
      \ to Google Maps are not ending as the company announced those features will\
      \ be transferred to Google's Local Guides programme.\n\nGoogle Maps' satellite\
      \ view is a \"top-down\" or \"birds eye\" view; most of the high-resolution\
      \ imagery of cities is aerial photography taken from aircraft flying at 800\
      \ to 1,500 feet (240 to 460 m), while most other imagery is from satellites.\
      \ Much of the available satellite imagery is no more than three years old and\
      \ is updated on a regular basis. Google Maps uses a close variant of the Mercator\
      \ projection, and therefore cannot accurately show areas around the poles.\n\
      \nThe current redesigned version of the desktop application was made available\
      \ in 2013, alongside the \"classic\" (pre-2013) version. Google Maps for mobile\
      \ was released in September 2008 and features GPS turn-by-turn navigation. In\
      \ August 2013, it was determined to be the world's most popular app for smartphones,\
      \ with over 54% of global smartphone owners using it at least once.\n\nIn 2012,\
      \ Google reported having over 7,100 employees and contractors directly working\
      \ in mapping."

    description: "Neptune is the eighth and farthest known planet from the Sun in\
      \ the Solar System. In the Solar System, it is the fourth-largest planet by\
      \ diameter, the third-most-massive planet, and the densest giant planet. Neptune\
      \ is 17 times the mass of Earth and is slightly more massive than its near-twin\
      \ Uranus, which is 15 times the mass of Earth and slightly larger than Neptune.\
      \ Neptune orbits the Sun once every 164.8 years at an average distance of 30.1\
      \ astronomical units (4.50\xD7109 km). It is named after the Roman god of the\
      \ sea and has the astronomical symbol \u2646, a stylised version of the god\
      \ Neptune's trident.\n\nNeptune is not visible to the unaided eye and is the\
      \ only planet in the Solar System found by mathematical prediction rather than\
      \ by empirical observation. Unexpected changes in the orbit of Uranus led Alexis\
      \ Bouvard to deduce that its orbit was subject to gravitational perturbation\
      \ by an unknown planet. Neptune was subsequently observed with a telescope on\
      \ 23 September 1846 by Johann Galle within a degree of the position predicted\
      \ by Urbain Le Verrier. Its largest moon, Triton, was discovered shortly thereafter,\
      \ though none of the planet's remaining known 14 moons were located telescopically\
      \ until the 20th century. The planet's distance from Earth gives it a very small\
      \ apparent size, making it challenging to study with Earth-based telescopes.\
      \ Neptune was visited by Voyager 2, when it flew by the planet on 25 August\
      \ 1989. The advent of the Hubble Space Telescope and large ground-based telescopes\
      \ with adaptive optics has recently allowed for additional detailed observations\
      \ from afar.\n\nLike Jupiter and Saturn, Neptune's atmosphere is composed primarily\
      \ of hydrogen and helium, along with traces of hydrocarbons and possibly nitrogen,\
      \ but it contains a higher proportion of \"ices\" such as water, ammonia, and\
      \ methane. However, its interior, like that of Uranus, is primarily composed\
      \ of ices and rock, which is why Uranus and Neptune are normally considered\
      \ \"ice giants\" to emphasise this distinction. Traces of methane in the outermost\
      \ regions in part account for the planet's blue appearance.\n\nIn contrast to\
      \ the hazy, relatively featureless atmosphere of Uranus, Neptune's atmosphere\
      \ has active and visible weather patterns. For example, at the time of the Voyager\
      \ 2 flyby in 1989, the planet's southern hemisphere had a Great Dark Spot comparable\
      \ to the Great Red Spot on Jupiter. These weather patterns are driven by the\
      \ strongest sustained winds of any planet in the Solar System, with recorded\
      \ wind speeds as high as 2,100 kilometres per hour (580 m/s; 1,300 mph). Because\
      \ of its great distance from the Sun, Neptune's outer atmosphere is one of the\
      \ coldest places in the Solar System, with temperatures at its cloud tops approaching\
      \ 55 K (\u2212218 \xB0C). Temperatures at the planet's centre are approximately\
      \ 5,400 K (5,100 \xB0C). Neptune has a faint and fragmented ring system (labelled\
      \ \"arcs\"), which was discovered in 1982, then later confirmed by Voyager 2."

    description: The blue-winged parrotlet (Forpus xanthopterygius) is a small parrot
      found in much of South America. The blue-winged parrotlet is mainly found in
      lowlands, but locally up to 1200m in south-eastern Brazil. It occurs in woodland,
      scrub, savanna, and pastures. Flocks are usually around 20 birds but can grow
      to over 50 around fruiting trees or seeding grasses. It is generally common
      and widespread, though more localized in the Amazon Basin.

    description: 'A personal computer (PC) is a multi-purpose electronic computer
      whose size, capabilities, and price make it feasible for individual use. PCs
      are intended to be operated directly by an end user, rather than by a computer
      expert or technician.

      "Computers were invented to ''compute'': to solve complex mathematical problems,
      but today, due to media dependency and the everyday use of computers, it is
      seen that ''computing'' is the least important thing computers do." The computer
      time-sharing models that were typically used with larger, more expensive minicomputer
      and mainframe systems, to enable them be used by many people at the same time,
      are not used with PCs.

      Early computer owners in the 1960s, invariably institutional or corporate, had
      to write their own programs to do any useful work with the machines. In the
      2010s, personal computer users have access to a wide range of commercial software,
      free software ("freeware") and free and open-source software, which are provided
      in ready-to-run form. Software for personal computers is typically developed
      and distributed independently from the hardware or OS manufacturers. Many personal
      computer users no longer need to write their own programs to make any use of
      a personal computer, although end-user programming is still feasible. This contrasts
      with systems such as smartphones or tablet computers, where software is often
      only available through a manufacturer-supported channel, and end-user program
      development may be discouraged by lack of support by the manufacturer.

      Since the early 1990s, Microsoft operating systems and Intel hardware have dominated
      much of the personal computer market, first with MS-DOS and then with Windows.
      Alternatives to Microsoft''s Windows operating systems occupy a minority share
      of the industry. These include Apple''s macOS and free open-source Unix-like
      operating systems such as Linux. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) provides the main
      alternative to Intel''s processors.'

    description: 'Phylo is an experimental video game about multiple sequence alignment
      optimisation. Developed by the McGill Centre for Bioinformatics, it was originally
      released as a free Flash game in November 2010. Designed as a game with a purpose,
      players solve pattern-matching puzzles that represent nucleotide sequences of
      different phylogenetic taxa to optimize alignments over a computer algorithm.
      By aligning together each nucleotide sequence, represented as differently coloured
      blocks, players attempt to create the highest point value score for each set
      of sequences by matching as many colours as possible and minimizing gaps.

      The nucleotide sequences generated by Phylo are obtained from actual sequence
      data from the UCSC Genome Browser. High-scoring player alignments are collected
      as data and sent back to the McGill Centre for Bioinformatics to be further
      evaluated with a stronger scoring algorithm. Those player alignments that score
      higher than the current computer-generated score will be re-introduced into
      the global alignment as an optimization.'

      \u30A2 Poketto Monsut\u0101 Rub\u012B & Safaia, \"Pocket Monsters: Ruby & Sapphire\"\
      ) are the third installments of the Pokemon series of role-playing video games,\
      \ developed by Game Freak and published by Nintendo for the Game Boy Advance.\
      \ The games were first released in Japan in late 2002 and internationally in\
      \ 2003. Pokemon Emerald, a special edition version, was released two years later\
      \ in each region. These three games (Pokemon Ruby, Sapphire, and Emerald) are\
      \ part of the third generation of the Pokemon video game series, also known\
      \ as the \"advanced generation\". Remakes of the two games, titled Omega Ruby\
      \ and Alpha Sapphire, were released for the Nintendo 3DS worldwide on November\
      \ 21, 2014, exactly twelve years to the date of the original Ruby and Sapphire\
      \ release date, with the exception of Europe, where it was released on November\
      \ 28, 2014.\n\nThe gameplay is mostly unchanged from the previous games; the\
      \ player controls the main character from an overhead perspective, and the controls\
      \ are largely the same as those of previous games. As with previous games, the\
      \ main objectives are to catch all of the Pokemon in the games and defeat the\
      \ Elite Four (a group of Pokemon trainers); also like their predecessors, the\
      \ games' main subplot involves the main character defeating a criminal organization\
      \ that attempts to take over the region. New features, such as double battles\
      \ and Pokemon abilities along with 135 new Pokemon, have been added. As the\
      \ Game Boy Advance is more powerful than its predecessors, four players may\
      \ be connected at a time instead of the previous limit of two. Additionally,\
      \ the games can be connected to an e-Reader or other advanced generation Pokemon\
      \ games."

    description: 'From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

      Traditional Polynesian navigation was used for thousands of years to make long
      voyages across thousands of miles of the open Pacific Ocean. Navigators travelled
      to small inhabited islands using wayfinding techniques and knowledge passed
      by oral tradition from master to apprentice, often in the form of song. Generally
      each island maintained a guild of navigators who had very high status; in times
      of famine or difficulty they could trade for aid or evacuate people to neighboring
      islands. As of 2014, these traditional navigation methods are still taught in
      the Polynesian outlier of Taumako Island in the Solomons.

      Polynesian navigation used some navigational instruments, which predate and
      are distinct from the machined metal tools used by European navigators (such
      as the sextant, first produced 1730, sea astrolabe, ~late 15th century, and
      marine chronometer, invented 1761). However, they also relied heavily on close
      observation of sea sign and a large body of knowledge from oral tradition.

      Both wayfinding techniques and outrigger canoe construction methods have been
      kept as guild secrets, but in the modern revival of these skills, they are being
      recorded and published.'

    description: A postage stamp is a small piece of paper that is purchased and displayed
      on an item of mail as evidence of payment of postage. Typically, stamps are
      printed on special custom-made paper, show a national designation and a denomination
      (value) on the front, and have an adhesive gum on the back or are self-adhesive.
      Postage stamps are purchased from a postal administration (post office) or other
      authorized vendor, and are used to pay for the costs involved in moving mail,
      as well as other business necessities such as insurance and registration. They
      are sometimes a source of net profit to the issuing agency, especially when
      sold to collectors who will not actually use them for postage.

    description: 'Rail transport is a means of transferring of passengers and goods
      on wheeled vehicles running on rails, also known as tracks. It is also commonly
      referred to as train transport. In contrast to road transport, where vehicles
      run on a prepared flat surface, rail vehicles (rolling stock) are directionally
      guided by the tracks on which they run. Tracks usually consist of steel rails,
      installed on ties (sleepers) and ballast, on which the rolling stock, usually
      fitted with metal wheels, moves. Other variations are also possible, such as
      slab track, where the rails are fastened to a concrete foundation resting on
      a prepared subsurface.

      Rolling stock in a rail transport system generally encounters lower frictional
      resistance than road vehicles, so passenger and freight cars (carriages and
      wagons) can be coupled into longer trains. The operation is carried out by a
      railway company, providing transport between train stations or freight customer
      facilities. Power is provided by locomotives which either draw electric power
      from a railway electrification system or produce their own power, usually by
      diesel engines. Most tracks are accompanied by a signalling system. Railways
      are a safe land transport system when compared to other forms of transport.[Nb
      1] Railway transport is capable of high levels of passenger and cargo utilization
      and energy efficiency, but is often less flexible and more capital-intensive
      than road transport, when lower traffic levels are considered.

      The oldest, man-hauled railways date back to the 6th century BC, with Periander,
      one of the Seven Sages of Greece, credited with its invention. Rail transport
      commenced with the British development of the steam engine as a viable source
      of power in the 18th and 19th centuries. Steam locomotives were first developed
      in the United Kingdom in the early 19th century. Built by George Stephenson
      and his son Robert''s company Robert Stephenson and Company, the Locomotion
      No. 1 is the first steam locomotive to carry passengers on a public rail line,
      the Stockton and Darlington Railway in 1825. George also built the first public
      inter-city railway line in the world to use steam locomotives, the Liverpool
      and Manchester Railway which opened in 1830. With steam engines, one could construct
      mainline railways, which were a key component of the Industrial Revolution.
      Also, railways reduced the costs of shipping, and allowed for fewer lost goods,
      compared with water transport, which faced occasional sinking of ships. The
      change from canals to railways allowed for "national markets" in which prices
      varied very little from city to city. The invention and development of the railway
      in the United Kingdom was one of the most important technological inventions
      of the 19th century.

      In the 1880s, electrified trains were introduced, and also the first tramways
      and rapid transit systems came into being. Starting during the 1940s, the non-electrified
      railways in most countries had their steam locomotives replaced by diesel-electric
      locomotives, with the process being almost complete by 2000. During the 1960s,
      electrified high-speed railway systems were introduced in Japan and later in
      some other countries. Other forms of guided ground transport outside the traditional
      railway definitions, such as monorail or maglev, have been tried but have seen
      limited use. Following decline after World War II due to competition from cars,
      rail transport has had a revival in recent decades due to road congestion and
      rising fuel prices, as well as governments investing in rail as a means of reducing
      CO2 emissions in the context of concerns about global warming.'

    description: 'Rogue is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books
      published by Marvel Comics, commonly in association with the X-Men. The character
      debuted in Avengers Annual #10 (November 1981) as a villain, but then soon after
      she joined the X-Men.

      Rogue is part of a subspecies of humans called mutants, who are born with superhuman
      abilities. Rogue has the involuntary ability to absorb and sometimes also remove
      the memories, physical strength, and superpowers of anyone she touches. Therefore,
      Rogue considers her powers to be a curse. For most of her life, she limited
      her physical contact with others, including her on-off love interest, Gambit.
      However, after many years, Rogue finally gained full control over her mutant
      ability.

      Hailing from the fictional Caldecott County, Mississippi, Rogue is the X-Men''s
      self-described southern belle. A runaway, she was adopted by Mystique of the
      Brotherhood of Evil Mutants and grew up as a villain. After Rogue permanently
      absorbs Ms. Marvel''s psyche and Kree powers, she reforms and turns to the X-Men,
      fearing for her sanity. Rogue''s real name and early history were not revealed
      until nearly 20 years after her introduction. Until the back story provided
      by Robert Rodi in the ongoing Rogue series, which began in September 2004, Rogue''s
      background was only hinted at. Her name was revealed as Anna Marie, although
      her surname is still unknown. She has sometimes adopted the name Raven, which
      is the first name of her foster mother Mystique.

      Rogue has been one of the most prominent members of the X-Men since the 1980s.
      She was #5 on IGN''s Top 25 X-Men list for 2006, #4 on their Top Ten X-Babes
      list for 2006, #3 on Marvel''s list of Top 10 Toughest Females for 2009 and
      was given title of #1 X-Man on CBR''s Top 50 X-Men of All Time for 2008. She
      was ranked tenth in Comics Buyer''s Guide''s "100 Sexiest Women in Comics" list.
      Rogue has been featured in most of the X-Men animated series, and various video
      games. In the X-Men film series, she is portrayed by Anna Paquin. Her visual
      cue is often the white streak that runs through her hair.'

    description: 'A ruby is a pink to blood-red colored gemstone, a variety of the
      mineral corundum (aluminium oxide). Other varieties of gem-quality corundum
      are called sapphires. Ruby is one of the traditional cardinal gems, together
      with amethyst, sapphire, emerald, and diamond. The word ruby comes from ruber,
      Latin for red. The color of a ruby is due to the element chromium.

      The quality of a ruby is determined by its color, cut, and clarity, which, along
      with carat weight, affect its value. The brightest and most valuable shade of
      red called blood-red or pigeon blood, commands a large premium over other rubies
      of similar quality. After color follows clarity: similar to diamonds, a clear
      stone will command a premium, but a ruby without any needle-like rutile inclusions
      may indicate that the stone has been treated. Ruby is the traditional birthstone
      for July and is usually more pink than garnet, although some rhodolite garnets
      have a similar pinkish hue to most rubies. The world''s most expensive ruby
      is the Sunrise Ruby.'

      and web pages. It encourages and facilitates the use of web standards such as
      JSON or XML for data transfer, and HTML, CSS and JavaScript for display and
      user interfacing. In addition to MVC, Rails emphasizes the use of other well-known
      software engineering patterns and paradigms, including convention over configuration
      (CoC), don't repeat yourself (DRY), and the active record pattern.

      Rutebok for Norge is an overview of the entire Norwegian public transport network
      containing timetables, prices, maps and other essential information. It also
      contains a list of Norwegian accommodation.


      Rutebok for Norge was first published in 1869 under the name "Norges Kommunikasjoner"
      or "Reiseblad". It got its current name in 1918 when it was merged with the
      state railways equivalent. The Rutebok was issued weekly 1880-1932, later every
      14 days. It has been published since 1991 by Norsk Reiseinformasjon AS with
      4 issues per year. Since 1994 an electronic version is also published, in the
      form of a CD-ROM containing the same information as the paper version; since
      2003 it has also been available online at http://www.rutebok.no.'

      in the different versions of TeachText that were created by various software
      development groups within Apple.

      It can be considered similar to Windows'' WordPad application. In later versions
      it also gained additional read only display capabilities for PICT files, as

      QuickTime movies. SimpleText can even record short sound samples and, using
      Apple''s PlainTalk speech system, read out text in English. Users who wanted
      to add sounds longer than 24 seconds, however, needed to use a separate program
      to create the sound and then paste the desired sound into the document using

      \ include trout, char, grayling and whitefish. Salmon are native to tributaries\
      \ of the North Atlantic (genus Salmo) and Pacific Ocean (genus Oncorhynchus).\
      \ Many species of salmon have been introduced into non-native environments such\
      \ as the Great Lakes of North America and Patagonia in South America. Salmon\
      \ are intensively farmed in many parts of the world.\n\nTypically, salmon are\
      \ anadromous: they are born in fresh water, migrate to the ocean, then return\
      \ to fresh water to reproduce. However, populations of several species are restricted\
      \ to fresh water through their lives. Various species of salmon display anadromous\
      \ life strategies while others display freshwater resident life strategies.\
      \ Folklore has it that the fish return to the exact spot where they were born\
      \ to spawn; tracking studies have shown this to be mostly true. A portion of\
      \ a returning salmon run may stray and spawn in different freshwater systems.\
      \ The percent of straying depends on the species of salmon. Homing behavior\
      \ has been shown to depend on olfactory memory"

      \ in automobile navigation systems, see Automotive navigation system.\nA satellite\
      \ navigation or satnav system is a system that uses satellites to provide autonomous\
      \ geo-spatial positioning. It allows small electronic receivers to determine\
      \ their location (longitude, latitude, and altitude/elevation) to high precision\
      \ (within a few metres) using time signals transmitted along a line of sight\
      \ by radio from satellites. The system can be used for providing position, navigation\
      \ or for tracking the position of something fitted with a receiver (satellite\
      \ tracking). The signals also allow the electronic receiver to calculate the\
      \ current local time to high precision, which allows time synchronisation. Satnav\
      \ systems operate independently of any telephonic or internet reception, though\
      \ these technologies can enhance the usefulness of the positioning information\
      \ generated.\n\nA satellite navigation system with global coverage may be termed\

      \ United States NAVSTAR Global Positioning System (GPS), the Russian GLONASS\

      \ process of developing regional navigation and augmentation systems as well.\n\
      \nGlobal coverage for each system is generally achieved by a satellite constellation\
      \ of 18-30 medium Earth orbit (MEO) satellites spread between several orbital\
      \ planes. The actual systems vary, but use orbital inclinations of >50\xB0 and\

      \ density of Earth, with its larger volume Saturn is just over 95 times more\
      \ massive. Saturn is named after the Roman god of agriculture; its astronomical\
      \ symbol (\u2644) represents the god's sickle.\n\nSaturn's interior is probably\
      \ composed of a core of iron-nickel and rock (silicon and oxygen compounds).\
      \ This core is surrounded by a deep layer of metallic hydrogen, an intermediate\
      \ layer of liquid hydrogen and liquid helium, and finally outside the Frenkel\
      \ line a gaseous outer layer. Saturn has a pale yellow hue due to ammonia crystals\
      \ in its upper atmosphere. Electrical current within the metallic hydrogen layer\
      \ is thought to give rise to Saturn's planetary magnetic field, which is weaker\
      \ than Earth's, but has a magnetic moment 580 times that of Earth due to Saturn's\
      \ larger size. Saturn's magnetic field strength is around one-twentieth of Jupiter's.\
      \ The outer atmosphere is generally bland and lacking in contrast, although\
      \ long-lived features can appear. Wind speeds on Saturn can reach 1,800 km/h\
      \ (500 m/s), higher than on Jupiter, but not as high as those on Neptune.\n\n\
      Saturn has a prominent ring system that consists of nine continuous main rings\
      \ and three discontinuous arcs and that is composed mostly of ice particles\
      \ with a smaller amount of rocky debris and dust. 62 moons are known to orbit\
      \ Saturn, of which fifty-three are officially named. This does not include the\
      \ hundreds of moonlets comprising the rings. Titan, Saturn's largest moon, and\
      \ the second-largest in the Solar System, is larger than the planet Mercury,\
      \ although less massive, and is the only moon in the Solar System to have a\
      \ substantial atmosphere."

    description: 'Harley-Davidson CVO (for Custom Vehicle Operations) motorcycles
      are a family of models created by Harley-Davidson for the factory custom market.
      For every model year since the program''s inception in 1999, Harley-Davidson
      has chosen a small selection of its mass-produced motorcycle models and created
      limited-edition customizations of those platforms with larger-displacement engines,
      costlier paint designs, and additional accessories not found on the mainstream
      models. Special features for the CVO lineup have included performance upgrades
      from Harley''s "Screamin'' Eagle" branded parts, hand-painted pinstripes, ostrich
      leather on seats and trunks, gold leaf incorporated in the paint, and electronic
      accessories like GPS navigation systems and iPod music players.

      CVO models are produced in Harley-Davidson''s York, Pennsylvania plant, where
      touring and Softail models are also manufactured. In each model year, CVO models
      feature larger-displacement engines than the mainstream models, and these larger-displacement
      engines make their way into the normal "big twin" line within a few years when
      CVO models are again upgraded. Accessories created for these customized units
      are sometimes offered in the Harley-Davidson accessory catalog for all models
      in later years, but badging and paint are kept exclusively for CVO model owners,
      and cannot be replaced without providing proof of ownership to the ordering
      dealer.'

      "Alpha Customer"; ride fast and hard.

    description: Sheet music is a handwritten or printed form of music notation that
      uses modern musical symbols to indicate the pitches (melodies), rhythms and/or
      chords of a song or instrumental musical piece. Like its analogs - printed books
      or pamphlets in English, Arabic or other languages - the medium of sheet music
      typically is paper (or, in earlier centuries, papyrus or parchment), although
      the access to musical notation since the 1980s has included the presentation
      of musical notation on computer screens and the development of scorewriter computer
      programs that can notate a song or piece electronically, and, in some cases,
      "play back" the notated music using a synthesizer or virtual instruments.

      small pots of medium grade bark mix under same conditions as for Gongora; shaded
      light, even moisture, drier in winter. It is a rarely seen relative of Stanhopea.

      \ muscle fibers, potentially including a bone. Exceptions, in which the meat\
      \ is sliced parallel to the fibers, include the skirt steak that is cut from\
      \ the plate, the flank steak that is cut from the abdominal muscles, and the\
      \ Silverfinger steak that is cut from the loin and includes three rib bones.\
      \ When the word \"steak\" is used without qualification, it generally refers\
      \ to a beefsteak. In a larger sense, there are also fish steaks, ground meat\
      \ steaks, pork steak and many more varieties of steaks.\n\nSteaks are usually\
      \ grilled, but they can be pan-fried, or broiled. Steak is often grilled in\
      \ an attempt to replicate the flavor of steak cooked over the glowing coals\
      \ of an open fire. Steak can also be cooked in sauce, such as in steak and kidney\
      \ pie, or minced and formed into patties, such as hamburgers.\n\nSteaks are\
      \ also cut from grazing animals, usually farmed, other than cattle, including\
      \ bison, camel, goat, horse, kangaroo, sheep, ostrich, pigs, reindeer, turkey,\
      \ deer and zebu as well as various types of fish, especially salmon and large\
      \ pelagic fish such as swordfish, shark and marlin. For some meats, such as\
      \ pork, lamb and mutton, chevon and veal, these cuts are often referred to as\
      \ chops. Some cured meat, such as gammon, is commonly served as steak.\n\nGrilled\
      \ Portobello mushroom may be called mushroom steak, and similarly for other\
      \ vegetarian dishes. Imitation steak is a food product that is formed into a\
      \ steak shape from various pieces of meat. Grilled fruits, such as watermelon\
      \ have been used as vegetarian steak alternatives."

    description: 'Stout is a dark beer made using roasted malt or roasted barley,
      hops, water and yeast. Stouts were traditionally the generic term for the strongest
      or stoutest porters, typically 7% or 8%, produced by a brewery. There are a
      number of variations including Baltic porter, milk stout, and imperial stout;
      the most common variation is dry stout, exemplified by Guinness Draught, the
      world''s best selling stout.[citation needed]

      The first known use of the word stout for beer was in a document dated 1677
      found in the Egerton Manuscript, the sense being that a stout beer was a strong
      beer not a dark beer. The name porter was first used in 1721 to describe a dark
      brown beer that had been made with roasted malts. Because of the huge popularity
      of porters, brewers made them in a variety of strengths. The stronger beers
      were called "stout porters", so the history and development of stout and porter
      are intertwined, and the term stout has become firmly associated with dark beer,
      rather than just strong beer.'

    description: 'Stroke play, also known as medal play, is a scoring system in the
      sport of golf. It involves counting the total number of strokes taken on each
      hole during a given round, or series of rounds. The winner is the player who
      has taken the fewest strokes over the course of the round, or rounds.

      Although most professional tournaments are played using the stroke play scoring
      system, there are, or have been, some notable exceptions, for example the WGC-Accenture
      Match Play Championship and Volvo World Match Play Championship, which are both
      played in a match play format, and The International, a former PGA Tour event
      that used a modified stableford system. Most team events, for example the Ryder
      Cup, are also contested using the match play format.'

    requirements: 'Most tournaments enforce a cut, which in a typical 72-hole tournament
      is done after 36 holes. The number of players who "make the cut" depends on
      the tournament rules - in a typical PGA Tour event the top 70 professionals
      (plus ties) after 36 holes. Any player who turns in a score higher than the
      "cut line" will "miss the cut" and take no further part in the tournament.

      Count back:

      One method commonly used in amateur competitions, especially when a playoff
      is not practicable, is a scorecard "count back", whereby comparing scores hole
      by hole starting with 17, then 16 and so on... the first player with a lower
      score is declared the loser. This ensures that the player who was in the lead
      before the tie occurred is declared the winner. To put it another way, to win
      a tournament one must equal and then pass the leader...not merely catch up to
      him.'

    description: 'The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a nearly
      perfect sphere of hot plasma, with internal convective motion that generates
      a magnetic field via a dynamo process. It is by far the most important source
      of energy for life on Earth. Its diameter is about 109 times that of Earth,
      and its mass is about 330,000 times that of Earth, accounting for about 99.86%
      of the total mass of the Solar System. About three quarters of the Sun''s mass
      consists of hydrogen (~73%); the rest is mostly helium (~25%), with much smaller
      quantities of heavier elements, including oxygen, carbon, neon, and iron.

      The Sun is a G-type main-sequence star (G2V) based on its spectral class. As
      such, it is informally referred to as a yellow dwarf. It formed approximately
      4.6 billion years ago from the gravitational collapse of matter within a region
      of a large molecular cloud. Most of this matter gathered in the center, whereas
      the rest flattened into an orbiting disk that became the Solar System. The central
      mass became so hot and dense that it eventually initiated nuclear fusion in
      its core. It is thought that almost all stars form by this process.

      The Sun is roughly middle-aged; it has not changed dramatically for more than
      four billion years, and will remain fairly stable for more than another five
      billion years. After hydrogen fusion in its core has diminished to the point
      at which it is no longer in hydrostatic equilibrium, the core of the Sun will
      experience a marked increase in density and temperature while its outer layers
      expand to eventually become a red giant. It is calculated that the Sun will
      become sufficiently large to engulf the current orbits of Mercury and Venus,
      and render Earth uninhabitable.

      The enormous effect of the Sun on Earth has been recognized since prehistoric
      times, and the Sun has been regarded by some cultures as a deity. The synodic
      rotation of Earth and its orbit around the Sun are the basis of the solar calendar,
      which is the predominant calendar in use today.'

    description: Ten is the debut studio album by American rock band Pearl Jam, released
      on August 27, 1991 through Epic Records. Following the disbanding of bassist
      Jeff Ament and guitarist Stone Gossard's previous group Mother Love Bone, the
      two recruited vocalist Eddie Vedder, guitarist Mike McCready, and drummer Dave
      Krusen to form Pearl Jam in 1990. Most of the songs began as instrumental jams,
      to which Vedder added lyrics about topics such as depression, homelessness,
      and abuse.

    description: Tennis is a racket sport that can be played individually against
      a single opponent (singles) or between two teams of two players each (doubles).
      Each player uses a tennis racket that is strung with cord to strike a hollow
      rubber ball covered with felt over or around a net and into the opponent's court.
      The object of the game is to play the ball in such a way that the opponent is
      not able to play a valid return. The player who is unable to return the ball
      will not gain a point, while the opposite player will.

    description: "Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun. It has the third-largest\
      \ planetary radius and fourth-largest planetary mass in the Solar System. Uranus\
      \ is similar in composition to Neptune, and both have different bulk chemical\
      \ composition from that of the larger gas giants Jupiter and Saturn. For this\
      \ reason, scientists often classify Uranus and Neptune as \"ice giants\" to\
      \ distinguish them from the gas giants. Uranus's atmosphere is similar to Jupiter's\
      \ and Saturn's in its primary composition of hydrogen and helium, but it contains\
      \ more \"ices\" such as water, ammonia, and methane, along with traces of other\
      \ hydrocarbons. It is the coldest planetary atmosphere in the Solar System,\
      \ with a minimum temperature of 49 K (\u2212224 \xB0C; \u2212371 \xB0F), and\
      \ has a complex, layered cloud structure with water thought to make up the lowest\
      \ clouds and methane the uppermost layer of clouds. The interior of Uranus is\
      \ mainly composed of ices and rock.\n\nUranus is the only planet whose name\
      \ is derived from a figure from Greek mythology, from the Latinised version\
      \ of the Greek god of the sky Ouranos. Like the other giant planets, Uranus\
      \ has a ring system, a magnetosphere, and numerous moons. The Uranian system\
      \ has a unique configuration among those of the planets because its axis of\
      \ rotation is tilted sideways, nearly into the plane of its solar orbit. Its\
      \ north and south poles, therefore, lie where most other planets have their\
      \ equators. In 1986, images from Voyager 2 showed Uranus as an almost featureless\
      \ planet in visible light, without the cloud bands or storms associated with\
      \ the other giant planets. Observations from Earth have shown seasonal change\
      \ and increased weather activity as Uranus approached its equinox in 2007. Wind\
      \ speeds can reach 250 metres per second (900 km/h; 560 mph)."

      \ Earth days. It has the longest rotation period (243 days) of any planet in\
      \ the Solar System and rotates in the opposite direction to most other planets.\
      \ It has no natural satellites. It is named after the Roman goddess of love\
      \ and beauty. It is the second-brightest natural object in the night sky after\
      \ the Moon, reaching an apparent magnitude of \u22124.6 - bright enough to cast\
      \ shadows at night and, rarely, visible to the naked eye in broad daylight.\
      \ Orbiting within Earth's orbit, Venus is an inferior planet and never appears\
      \ to venture far from the Sun; its maximum angular distance from the Sun (elongation)\
      \ is 47.8\xB0.\n\nVenus is a terrestrial planet and is sometimes called Earth's\
      \ \"sister planet\" because of their similar size, mass, proximity to the Sun,\
      \ and bulk composition. It is radically different from Earth in other respects.\
      \ It has the densest atmosphere of the four terrestrial planets, consisting\
      \ of more than 96% carbon dioxide. The atmospheric pressure at the planet's\
      \ surface is 92 times that of Earth, or roughly the pressure found 900 m (3,000\
      \ ft) underwater on Earth. Venus is by far the hottest planet in the Solar System,\
      \ with a mean surface temperature of 735 K (462 \xB0C; 863 \xB0F), even though\
      \ Mercury is closer to the Sun. Venus is shrouded by an opaque layer of highly\
      \ reflective clouds of sulfuric acid, preventing its surface from being seen\
      \ from space in visible light. It may have had water oceans in the past, but\
      \ these would have vaporized as the temperature rose due to a runaway greenhouse\
      \ effect. The water has probably photodissociated, and the free hydrogen has\

      and manufactured by Nintendo. Released in 1995, it was marketed as the first
      console capable of displaying stereoscopic 3D graphics. The player uses the
      console in a manner similar to a head-mounted display, placing their head against
      the eyepiece to see a red monochrome display. The games use a parallax effect
      to create the illusion of depth. Sales failed to meet targets, and by early
      1996, Nintendo ceased distribution and game development, only ever releasing
      22 games for the system.

      rind and no internal division, botanically called a pepo. The sweet, juicy flesh
      is usually deep red to pink, with many black seeds. The fruit can be eaten raw
      or pickled and the rind is edible after cooking.

      \ known throughout Germany, though better known as Weizen (\"Wheat\") outside\
      \ Bavaria. The terms Hefeweizen (\"yeast wheat\") or Hefewei\xDFbier refer to\

    description: is one of two extant subspecies of Equus ferus. It is an odd-toed
      ungulate mammal belonging to the taxonomic family Equidae. The horse has evolved
      over the past 45 to 55 million years from a small multi-toed creature, Eohippus,
      into the large, single-toed animal of today. Humans began to domesticate horses
      around 4000 BC, and their domestication is believed to have been widespread
      by 3000 BC. Horses in the subspecies caballus are domesticated, although some
      domesticated populations live in the wild as feral horses. These feral populations
      are not true wild horses, as this term is used to describe horses that have
      never been domesticated, such as the endangered Przewalski's horse, a separate
      subspecies, and the only remaining true wild horse. There is an extensive, specialized
      vocabulary used to describe equine-related concepts, covering everything from
      anatomy to life stages, size, colors, markings, breeds, locomotion, and behavior.

      / (About this sound listen) WIK-ee-PEE-dee-\u0259) is a free online encyclopedia\
      \ with the aim to allow anyone to edit articles. Wikipedia is the largest and\
      \ most popular general reference work on the Internet and is ranked among the\
      \ ten most popular websites. Wikipedia is owned by the nonprofit Wikimedia Foundation.\n\
      \nWikipedia was launched on January 15, 2001, by Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger.\
      \ Sanger coined its name, a portmanteau of wiki[notes 4] and encyclopedia. There\
      \ was only the English-language version initially, but it quickly developed\
      \ similar versions in other languages, which differ in content and in editing\
      \ practices. With 5,459,675 articles,[notes 5] the English Wikipedia is the\
      \ largest of the more than 290 Wikipedia encyclopedias. Overall, Wikipedia consists\
      \ of more than 40 million articles in more than 250 different languages and,\
      \ as of February 2014, it had 18 billion page views and nearly 500 million unique\
      \ visitors each month.\n\nAs of March 2017, Wikipedia has about forty thousand\
      \ high-quality articles known as Featured Articles and Good Articles that cover\
      \ vital topics. In 2005, Nature published a peer review comparing 42 science\
      \ articles from Encyclop\xE6dia Britannica and Wikipedia, and found that Wikipedia's\
      \ level of accuracy approached that of Encyclop\xE6dia Britannica.\n\nWikipedia\
      \ has been criticized for allegedly exhibiting systemic bias, presenting a mixture\
      \ of \"truths, half truths, and some falsehoods\", and, in controversial topics,\
      \ being subject to manipulation and spin."

    description: A witch doctor was originally a type of healer who treated ailments
      believed to be caused by witchcraft. The term witch doctor is sometimes used
      to refer to healers, particularly in third world regions, who use traditional
      healing rather than contemporary medicine. In contemporary society, "witch doctor"
      is sometimes used derisively to refer to chiropractors,[dubious - discuss] homeopaths
      and faith healers.

    description: 'The gray wolf or grey wolf (Canis lupus), also known as the timber
      wolf or western wolf, is a canine native to the wilderness and remote areas
      of Eurasia and North America. It is the largest extant member of its family,
      with males averaging 43-45 kg (95-99 lb) and females 36-38.5 kg (79-85 lb).
      Like the red wolf, it is distinguished from other Canis species by its larger
      size and less pointed features, particularly on the ears and muzzle. Its winter
      fur is long and bushy and predominantly a mottled gray in color, although nearly
      pure white, red, and brown to black also occur. As of 2005, 37 subspecies of
      C. lupus are recognised by MSW3.


      The gray wolf is the second most specialised member of the genus Canis, after
      the Ethiopian wolf, as demonstrated by its morphological adaptations to hunting
      large prey, its more gregarious nature, and its highly advanced expressive behavior.
      It is nonetheless closely related enough to smaller Canis species, such as the
      eastern wolf, coyote, and golden jackal, to produce fertile hybrids. It is the
      only species of Canis to have a range encompassing both the Old and New Worlds,
      and originated in Eurasia during the Pleistocene, colonizing North America on
      at least three separate occasions during the Rancholabrean. It is a social animal,
      travelling in nuclear families consisting of a mated pair, accompanied by the
      pair''s adult offspring. The gray wolf is typically an apex predator throughout
      its range, with only humans and tigers posing a serious threat to it. It feeds
      primarily on large ungulates, though it also eats smaller animals, livestock,
      carrion, and garbage.'

      animals.

    description: 'Wolverine (born James Howlett commonly known as Logan and sometimes
      as Weapon X) is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published
      by Marvel Comics, mostly in association with the X-Men. He is a mutant who possesses
      animal-keen senses, enhanced physical capabilities, powerful regenerative ability
      known as a healing factor, and three retractable bone claws in each hand. Wolverine
      has been depicted variously as a member of the X-Men, Alpha Flight, and the
      Avengers.

      The character appeared in the last panel of The Incredible Hulk #180 before
      having a larger role in #181 (cover-dated Nov. 1974). He was created by writer
      Len Wein and Marvel art director John Romita, Sr., who designed the character,
      and was first drawn for publication by Herb Trimpe. Wolverine then joined a
      revamped version of the superhero team the X-Men, where eventually writer Chris
      Claremont and artist-writer John Byrne would play significant roles in the character''s
      development. Artist Frank Miller collaborated with Claremont and helped to revise
      the character with a four-part eponymous limited series from September to December
      1982 which debuted Wolverine''s catchphrase, "I''m the best there is at what
      I do, but what I do best isn''t very nice."

      Wolverine is typical of the many tough antiheroes that emerged in American popular
      culture after the Vietnam War; his willingness to use deadly force and his brooding
      nature became standard characteristics for comic book antiheroes by the end
      of the 1980s. As a result, the character became a fan favorite of the increasingly
      popular X-Men franchise, and has been featured in his own solo comic since 1988.

      He has appeared in most X-Men adaptations, including animated television series,
      video games, and the live-action 20th Century Fox X-Men film series, in which
      he is portrayed by Hugh Jackman in nine of the ten films. The character is highly
      rated in many comics best-of lists, ranked #1 in Wizard magazine''s 2008 Top
      200 Comic Book Characters; 4th in Empire''s 2008 Greatest Comic Characters;
      and 4th on IGN''s 2011 Top 100 Comic Book Heroes.'

    description: Writing is a medium of human communication that represents language
      and emotion with signs and symbols. In most languages, writing is a complement
      to speech or spoken language. Writing is not a language, but a tool developed
      by human society. Within a language system, writing relies on many of the same
      structures as speech, such as vocabulary, grammar, and semantics, with the added
      dependency of a system of signs or symbols. The result of writing is called
      text, and the recipient of text is called a reader. Motivations for writing
      include publication, storytelling, correspondence and diary. Writing has been
      instrumental in keeping history, maintaining culture, dissemination of knowledge
      through the media and the formation of legal systems.
