    description: 'A personal computer (PC) is a multi-purpose electronic computer
      whose size, capabilities, and price make it feasible for individual use. PCs
      are intended to be operated directly by an end user, rather than by a computer
      expert or technician.


      "Computers were invented to ''compute'': to solve complex mathematical problems,
      but today, due to media dependency and the everyday use of computers, it is
      seen that ''computing'' is the least important thing computers do."[1] The computer
      time-sharing models that were typically used with larger, more expensive minicomputer
      and mainframe systems, to enable them be used by many people at the same time,
      are not used with PCs.


      Early computer owners in the 1960s, invariably institutional or corporate, had
      to write their own programs to do any useful work with the machines. In the
      2010s, personal computer users have access to a wide range of commercial software,
      free software ("freeware") and free and open-source software, which are provided
      in ready-to-run form. Software for personal computers is typically developed
      and distributed independently from the hardware or OS manufacturers.[2] Many
      personal computer users no longer need to write their own programs to make any
      use of a personal computer, although end-user programming is still feasible.
      This contrasts with systems such as smartphones or tablet computers, where software
      is often only available through a manufacturer-supported channel, and end-user
      program development may be discouraged by lack of support by the manufacturer.


      Since the early 1990s, Microsoft operating systems and Intel hardware have dominated
      much of the personal computer market, first with MS-DOS and then with Windows.
      Alternatives to Microsoft''s Windows operating systems occupy a minority share
      of the industry. These include Apple''s macOS and free open-source Unix-like
      operating systems such as Linux. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) provides the main
      alternative to Intel''s processors.'

    description: 'Rail transport is a means of transferring of passengers and goods
      on wheeled vehicles running on rails, also known as tracks. It is also commonly
      referred to as train transport. In contrast to road transport, where vehicles
      run on a prepared flat surface, rail vehicles (rolling stock) are directionally
      guided by the tracks on which they run. Tracks usually consist of steel rails,
      installed on ties (sleepers) and ballast, on which the rolling stock, usually
      fitted with metal wheels, moves. Other variations are also possible, such as
      slab track, where the rails are fastened to a concrete foundation resting on
      a prepared subsurface.


      Rolling stock in a rail transport system generally encounters lower frictional
      resistance than road vehicles, so passenger and freight cars (carriages and
      wagons) can be coupled into longer trains. The operation is carried out by a
      railway company, providing transport between train stations or freight customer
      facilities. Power is provided by locomotives which either draw electric power
      from a railway electrification system or produce their own power, usually by
      diesel engines. Most tracks are accompanied by a signalling system. Railways
      are a safe land transport system when compared to other forms of transport.[Nb
      1] Railway transport is capable of high levels of passenger and cargo utilization
      and energy efficiency, but is often less flexible and more capital-intensive
      than road transport, when lower traffic levels are considered.


      The oldest, man-hauled railways date back to the 6th century BC, with Periander,
      one of the Seven Sages of Greece, credited with its invention. Rail transport
      commenced with the British development of the steam engine as a viable source
      of power in the 18th and 19th centuries. Steam locomotives were first developed
      in the United Kingdom in the early 19th century. Built by George Stephenson
      and his son Robert''s company Robert Stephenson and Company, the Locomotion
      No. 1 is the first steam locomotive to carry passengers on a public rail line,
      the Stockton and Darlington Railway in 1825. George also built the first public
      inter-city railway line in the world to use steam locomotives, the Liverpool
      and Manchester Railway which opened in 1830. With steam engines, one could construct
      mainline railways, which were a key component of the Industrial Revolution.
      Also, railways reduced the costs of shipping, and allowed for fewer lost goods,
      compared with water transport, which faced occasional sinking of ships. The
      change from canals to railways allowed for "national markets" in which prices
      varied very little from city to city. The invention and development of the railway
      in the United Kingdom was one of the most important technological inventions
      of the 19th century.


      In the 1880s, electrified trains were introduced, and also the first tramways
      and rapid transit systems came into being. Starting during the 1940s, the non-electrified
      railways in most countries had their steam locomotives replaced by diesel-electric
      locomotives, with the process being almost complete by 2000. During the 1960s,
      electrified high-speed railway systems were introduced in Japan and later in
      some other countries. Other forms of guided ground transport outside the traditional
      railway definitions, such as monorail or maglev, have been tried but have seen
      limited use. Following decline after World War II due to competition from cars,
      rail transport has had a revival in recent decades due to road congestion and
      rising fuel prices, as well as governments investing in rail as a means of reducing
      CO2 emissions in the context of concerns about global warming.'

    description: 'A map is a symbolic depiction emphasizing relationships between
      elements of some space, such as objects, regions, or themes.


      Many maps are static, fixed to paper or some other durable medium, while others
      are dynamic or interactive. Although most commonly used to depict geography,
      maps may represent any space, real or imagined, without regard to context or
      scale, such as in brain mapping, DNA mapping, or computer network topology mapping.
      The space being mapped may be two dimensional, such as the surface of the earth,
      three dimensional, such as the interior of the earth, or even more abstract
      spaces of any dimension, such as arise in modeling phenomena having many independent
      variables.


      Although the earliest maps known are of the heavens, geographic maps of territory
      have a very long tradition and exist from ancient times. The word "map" comes
      from the medieval Latin Mappa mundi, wherein mappa meant napkin or cloth and
      mundi the world. Thus, "map" became the shortened term referring to a two-dimensional
      representation of the surface of the world.'

      Hartley, Moore and Potter counties and now includes the Lit Farms -- 5000 acres
      of farmland in Hartley and Moore Counties. The ranch's history is as old as
      the history of the Texas Panhandle. The ranch began in the 1880s when Major
      Littlefield discovered the value of the mild climate and protection of the river
      breaks when trail driving cattle from Abilene to Dodge City. Major Littlefield
      sold the ranch to the Prairie Land and Cattle Company, a Scottish land company,
      who developed the ranch into a 240,000 acre ranch stretching from Tascosa to
      Dumas. Lee Bivins purchased the ranch from Prairie in the early 1900s and it
      was operated by the Bivins until 1980s when it was purchased by the W. H. O'Brien
      family of Amarillo, Texas

      \ based on magnetic sensor data from a smartphone used to wirelessly locate\
      \ objects or people inside a building.[1]\n\nThere is currently no de facto\
      \ standard for IPS, however magnetic positioning appears to be the most complete\
      \ and cost effective[citation needed]. It offers accuracy without any hardware\
      \ requirements and a relatively low total cost of ownership[citation needed].\
      \ According to Opus Research magnetic positioning will emerge as a \u201Cfoundational\u201D\
      \ indoor location technology.[2]\n\nMagnetic positioning was invented by Professor\
      \ Janne Haverinen and Anssi Kemppainen.[3] Noticing that buildings' magnetic\
      \ distortions were leading machines astray, they eventually turned the problem\
      \ around and focused attention on the magnetic interferences caused by steel\
      \ structures. What they found was that the disturbances inside them were consistent,\
      \ creating a magnetic fingerprint unique to a building.[4]\n\nProfessor Janne\
      \ Haverinen founded the company IndoorAtlas in 2012 to commercialize the magnetic\
      \ positioning solution with dual headquarters in Mountain View, CA and Oulu,\
      \ Finland.[5]"

    description: 'Jean Grey-Summers (born Jean Elaine Grey) is a fictional superhero
      appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character
      has been known under the aliases Marvel Girl, Phoenix, and Dark Phoenix. Created
      by writer Stan Lee and artist Jack Kirby, the character first appeared in The
      X-Men #1 (September 1963).


      Jean Grey is a member of a subspecies of humans known as mutants, who are born
      with superhuman abilities. She was born with telepathic and telekinetic powers.
      Her powers first manifested when she saw her childhood friend being hit by a
      car. She is a caring, nurturing figure, but she also has to deal with being
      an Omega-level mutant and the physical manifestation of the cosmic Phoenix Force.
      Jean Grey experienced a transformation into the Phoenix in the X-Men storyline
      "The Dark Phoenix Saga". She has faced death numerous times in the history of
      the series. Her first death was under her guise as Marvel Girl, when she died
      and was "reborn" as Phoenix in "The Dark Phoenix Saga". This transformation
      led to her second death, which was suicide, though not her last.


      She is an important figure in the lives of other Marvel Universe characters,
      mostly the X-Men, including her husband Cyclops, her mentor and father figure
      Charles Xavier, her unrequited love interest Wolverine, her best friend and
      sister-like figure Storm, and her genetic children Rachel Summers, X-Man, Cable,
      and Stryfe.


      The character was present for much of the X-Men''s history, and she was featured
      in all three X-Men animated series and several video games. She is a playable
      character in X-Men Legends (2004), X-Men Legends II: Rise of Apocalypse (2005),
      Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2 (2009), Marvel vs Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds (2011),
      Marvel Heroes (2013), and Lego Marvel Super Heroes (2013), and appeared as a
      non-playable in the first Marvel: Ultimate Alliance.


      Famke Janssen portrayed the character in five installments of the X-Men films.
      Sophie Turner portrays a younger version in the 2016 film X-Men: Apocalypse.


      In 2006, IGN rated Jean Grey 6th on their list of top 25 X-Men from the past
      forty years,[1] and in 2011, IGN ranked her 13th in the "Top 100 Comic Book
      Heroes".[2] Her Dark Phoenix persona was ranked 9th in IGN''s "Top 100 Comic
      Book Villains of All Time" list, the highest rank for a female character.[3]'

    description: 'Wolverine (born James Howlett[2] commonly known as Logan and sometimes
      as Weapon X) is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published
      by Marvel Comics, mostly in association with the X-Men. He is a mutant who possesses
      animal-keen senses, enhanced physical capabilities, powerful regenerative ability
      known as a healing factor, and three retractable bone claws in each hand. Wolverine
      has been depicted variously as a member of the X-Men, Alpha Flight, and the
      Avengers.


      The character appeared in the last panel of The Incredible Hulk #180 before
      having a larger role in #181 (cover-dated Nov. 1974). He was created by writer
      Len Wein and Marvel art director John Romita, Sr., who designed the character,
      and was first drawn for publication by Herb Trimpe. Wolverine then joined a
      revamped version of the superhero team the X-Men, where eventually writer Chris
      Claremont and artist-writer John Byrne would play significant roles in the character''s
      development. Artist Frank Miller collaborated with Claremont and helped to revise
      the character with a four-part eponymous limited series from September to December
      1982 which debuted Wolverine''s catchphrase, "I''m the best there is at what
      I do, but what I do best isn''t very nice."


      Wolverine is typical of the many tough antiheroes that emerged in American popular
      culture after the Vietnam War;[3] his willingness to use deadly force and his
      brooding nature became standard characteristics for comic book antiheroes by
      the end of the 1980s.[4] As a result, the character became a fan favorite of
      the increasingly popular X-Men franchise,[5] and has been featured in his own
      solo comic since 1988.


      He has appeared in most X-Men adaptations, including animated television series,
      video games, and the live-action 20th Century Fox X-Men film series, in which
      he is portrayed by Hugh Jackman in nine of the ten films. The character is highly
      rated in many comics best-of lists, ranked #1 in Wizard magazine''s 2008 Top
      200 Comic Book Characters;[6] 4th in Empire''s 2008 Greatest Comic Characters;[7]
      and 4th on IGN''s 2011 Top 100 Comic Book Heroes.[8]'

    description: 'Iron Man (Tony Stark) is a fictional superhero appearing in American
      comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character was created by writer
      and editor Stan Lee, developed by scripter Larry Lieber, and designed by artists
      Don Heck and Jack Kirby. The character made his first appearance in Tales of
      Suspense #39 (cover dated March 1963).


      A wealthy American business magnate, playboy, and ingenious scientist, Tony
      Stark suffers a severe chest injury during a kidnapping in which his captors
      attempt to force him to build a weapon of mass destruction. He instead creates
      a powered suit of armor to save his life and escape captivity. Later, Stark
      augments his suit with weapons and other technological devices he designed through
      his company, Stark Industries. He uses the suit and successive versions to protect
      the world as Iron Man, while at first concealing his true identity. Initially,
      Iron Man was a vehicle for Stan Lee to explore Cold War themes, particularly
      the role of American technology and business in the fight against communism.[1]
      Subsequent re-imaginings of Iron Man have transitioned from Cold War themes
      to contemporary concerns, such as corporate crime and terrorism.[1]


      Throughout most of the character''s publication history, Iron Man has been a
      founding member of the superhero team the Avengers and has been featured in
      several incarnations of his own various comic book series. Iron Man has been
      adapted for several animated TV shows and films. The character is portrayed
      by Robert Downey Jr. in the live action film Iron Man (2008), which was a critical
      and box office success. Downey, who received much acclaim for his performance,
      reprised the role in a cameo in The Incredible Hulk (2008), two Iron Man sequels
      Iron Man 2 (2010) and Iron Man 3 (2013), The Avengers (2012), Avengers: Age
      of Ultron (2015), Captain America: Civil War (2016), and Spider-Man: Homecoming
      (2017), and will do so again in Avengers: Infinity War (2018) and its untitled
      sequel (2019) in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.


      Iron Man was ranked 12th on IGN''s "Top 100 Comic Book Heroes" in 2011,[2] and
      third in their list of "The Top 50 Avengers" in 2012.[3]'

    description: 'Rogue is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books
      published by Marvel Comics, commonly in association with the X-Men. The character
      debuted in Avengers Annual #10 (November 1981) as a villain, but then soon after
      she joined the X-Men.


      Rogue is part of a subspecies of humans called mutants, who are born with superhuman
      abilities. Rogue has the involuntary ability to absorb and sometimes also remove
      the memories, physical strength, and superpowers of anyone she touches. Therefore,
      Rogue considers her powers to be a curse. For most of her life, she limited
      her physical contact with others, including her on-off love interest, Gambit.
      However, after many years, Rogue finally gained full control over her mutant
      ability.


      Hailing from the fictional Caldecott County, Mississippi, Rogue is the X-Men''s
      self-described southern belle. A runaway, she was adopted by Mystique of the
      Brotherhood of Evil Mutants and grew up as a villain. After Rogue permanently
      absorbs Ms. Marvel''s psyche and Kree powers, she reforms and turns to the X-Men,
      fearing for her sanity. Rogue''s real name and early history were not revealed
      until nearly 20 years after her introduction. Until the back story provided
      by Robert Rodi in the ongoing Rogue series, which began in September 2004, Rogue''s
      background was only hinted at. Her name was revealed as Anna Marie, although
      her surname is still unknown. She has sometimes adopted the name Raven, which
      is the first name of her foster mother Mystique.[2]


      Rogue has been one of the most prominent members of the X-Men since the 1980s.
      She was #5 on IGN''s Top 25 X-Men list for 2006,[3] #4 on their Top Ten X-Babes
      list for 2006,[4] #3 on Marvel''s list of Top 10 Toughest Females for 2009[5]
      and was given title of #1 X-Man on CBR''s Top 50 X-Men of All Time for 2008.[6]
      She was ranked tenth in Comics Buyer''s Guide''s "100 Sexiest Women in Comics"
      list.[7] Rogue has been featured in most of the X-Men animated series, and various
      video games. In the X-Men film series, she is portrayed by Anna Paquin. Her
      visual cue is often the white streak that runs through her hair.'

    description: 'Beast (Henry Philip "Hank" McCoy) is a fictional superhero appearing
      in American comic books published by Marvel Comics and is a founding member
      of the X-Men. Originally called "The Beast", the character was introduced as
      a mutant possessing ape-like superhuman physical strength and agility, oversize
      hands and feet, a genius-level intellect, and an otherwise normal appearance.
      Eventually being referred to simply as "Beast", Hank McCoy underwent progressive
      physiological transformations, permanently gaining animalistic physical characteristics.
      These include blue fur, both simian and feline facial features, pointed ears,
      fangs, and claws. Beast''s physical strength and senses increased to even greater
      levels.


      Despite Hank McCoy''s inhuman appearance, he is depicted as a brilliant, well-educated
      man in the arts and sciences, known for his witty sense of humor. He is a world
      authority on biochemistry and genetics, the X-Men''s medical doctor, and the
      science and mathematics instructor at the Xavier Institute (the X-Men''s headquarters
      and school for young mutants). He is also a mutant political activist, campaigning
      against society''s bigotry and discrimination against mutants. While fighting
      his own bestial instincts and fears of social rejection, Beast dedicates his
      physical and mental gifts to the creation of a better world for man and mutant.


      One of the original X-Men, Beast has appeared regularly in X-Men-related comics
      since his debut. He has also been a member of the Avengers and Defenders.


      The character has also appeared in media adaptations, including animated TV
      series and feature films. In X2, Steve Bacic portrayed him in a very brief cameo
      in his human appearance, while in X-Men: The Last Stand he was played by Kelsey
      Grammer. Nicholas Hoult portrays a younger version of the character in X-Men:
      First Class. Both Hoult and Grammer reprise their roles in X-Men: Days of Future
      Past. Hoult also reprised the role in X-Men: Apocalypse.'

    description: 'Magneto is a fictional character appearing in American comic books
      published by Marvel Comics, commonly in association with the X-Men. Created
      by writer Stan Lee and artist Jack Kirby, the character first appears in The
      X-Men #1 (cover-dated Sept. 1963) as the archenemy of the X-Men.


      The character is a powerful mutant, one of a fictional subspecies of humanity
      born with superhuman abilities, who has the ability to generate and control
      magnetic fields. Magneto regards mutants as evolutionarily superior to humans
      and rejects the possibility of peaceful human-mutant coexistence; he aims to
      conquer the world to enable mutants (whom he refers to as "homo superior") to
      replace humans as the dominant species. Writers have since fleshed out his origins
      and motivations, revealing him to be a Holocaust survivor whose extreme methods
      and cynical philosophy derive from his determination to protect mutantkind from
      suffering a similar fate at the hands of a world that fears and persecutes mutants.
      He is a friend of Professor X, the leader of the X-Men, but their different
      philosophies cause a rift in their friendship at times. Magneto''s role in comics
      has varied from supervillain to antihero to superhero, having served as an occasional
      ally and even a member of the X-Men at times.


      His character''s early history has been compared with the civil rights leader
      Malcolm X[8][9] and Jewish Defense League founder Meir Kahane.[10][11] Magneto
      opposes the pacifist attitude of Professor X and pushes for a more aggressive
      approach to achieving civil rights. In 2011, IGN ranked Magneto as the greatest
      comic book villain of all time.[12]


      Sir Ian McKellen portrayed Magneto in four films of the X-Men film series, while
      Michael Fassbender portrayed a younger version of the character in three films.'

    description: In the primary Earth-616 continuity of the Marvel Universe, Blink
      was introduced in the "Phalanx Covenant" storyline, in which the extraterrestrially
      derived techno-organic beings called the Phalanx captured her and several other
      young mutants to assimilate their powers.[2] This version of Blink was tense
      and panicky and frightened of her powers (having "woken up in a pool of blood"
      after her first use of them). Clarice could not properly control her powers,
      and apparently was unable to teleport anything in an intact form. Instead, any
      object or person caught in Blink's teleportation field, also known as a "blink
      wave", would be shredded. She eventually used her abilities to "cut up" Harvest,
      a Phalanx entity guarding her and her peers, but she was caught in her own teleportation
      field and apparently died in the process.[3] Because of her sacrifice, the remaining
      captives were set free and became the X-Men junior team Generation X.[4]

    description: 'Lampreys (sometimes also called, inaccurately, lamprey eels) are
      any jawless fish of the order Petromyzontiformes, placed in the superclass Cyclostomata.
      The adult lamprey may be characterized by a toothed, funnel-like sucking mouth.
      The common name "lamprey" is probably derived from Latin lampetra, which may
      mean "stone licker" (lambere "to lick" + petra "stone"), though the etymology
      is uncertain.[3]


      Currently there are about 38 known extant species of lampreys.[4] Parasitic
      species are the best known, and feed by boring into the flesh of other fish
      to suck their blood;[5] but only 18 species of lampreys are parasitic.[6] Parasitic
      lampreys also attach themselves to larger animals to get a free ride.[7] Adults
      of the non-parasitic species do not feed; they live off reserves acquired as
      ammocoetes (larvae), which they obtain through filter feeding.


      The lampreys are a very ancient lineage of vertebrates, though their exact relationship
      to hagfishes and jawed vertebrates is still a matter of dispute.'

      While most often played as a team sport with five players on each side, three-on-three,
      two-on-two, and one-on-one competitions are also common. The objective is to
      shoot a ball through a hoop 18 inches (46 cm) in diameter and 10 feet (3.048
      m) high that is mounted to a backboard at each end of the court. The game was

      of the Kansas Jayhawks, one of the most successful programs in the game's history.

    description: 'Deadpool (Wade Winston Wilson) is a fictional antihero appearing
      in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by artist/writer
      Rob Liefeld and writer Fabian Nicieza, the character first appeared in The New
      Mutants #98 (cover-dated February 1991). Initially Deadpool was depicted as
      a supervillain when he made his first appearance in The New Mutants and later
      in issues of X-Force, but later evolved into his more recognizable antiheroic
      persona. Deadpool, whose real name is Wade Wilson, is a disfigured and mentally
      unstable mercenary with the superhuman ability of an accelerated healing factor
      and physical prowess. The character is known as the "Merc with a Mouth" because
      of his talkative nature and tendency to break the fourth wall, which is used
      by writers for humorous effect and running gags.


      The character''s popularity has seen him feature in numerous other media. In
      the 2004 series Cable & Deadpool, he refers to his own scarred appearance as
      "Ryan Reynolds crossed with a Shar Pei".[6][7] Reynolds himself would eventually
      portray the character in the 2009 film X-Men Origins: Wolverine and reprised
      the role in the 2016 film Deadpool.[8][9][10]'

    description: The great white shark (Carcharodon carcharias), also known as the
      great white, white pointer, white shark, or white death, is a species of large
      mackerel shark which can be found in the coastal surface waters of all the major
      oceans. The great white shark is notable for its size, with larger female individuals
      growing to 6.1 m (20 ft) in length and 1,950 kg (4,300 lb) in weight at maturity.[3][4][5]
      However most are smaller, males measuring 3.4 to 4.0 m (11 to 13 ft) and females
      4.6 to 4.9 m (15 to 16 ft) on average.[5][6] According to a 2014 study the lifespan
      of great white sharks is estimated to be as long as 70 years or more, well above
      previous estimates,[7] making it one of the longest lived cartilaginous fish
      currently known.[8] According to the same study, male great white sharks take
      26 years to reach sexual maturity, while the females take 33 years to be ready
      to produce offspring.[9] Great white sharks can swim at speeds of over 56 km/h
      (35 mph),[10] and can swim to depths of 1,200 m (3,900 ft).[11]

    description: Watermelon Citrullus lanatus var. lanatus is a scrambling and trailing
      vine in the flowering plant family Cucurbitaceae. The species originated in
      southern Africa, and there is evidence of its cultivation in Ancient Egypt.
      It is grown in tropical and sub-tropical areas worldwide for its large edible
      fruit, also known as a watermelon, which is a special kind of berry with a hard
      rind and no internal division, botanically called a pepo. The sweet, juicy flesh
      is usually deep red to pink, with many black seeds. The fruit can be eaten raw
      or pickled and the rind is edible after cooking.

    description: 'Management (or managing) is the administration of an organization,
      whether it be a business, a not-for-profit organization, or government body.
      Management includes the activities of setting the strategy of an organization
      and coordinating the efforts of its employees or volunteers to accomplish its
      objectives through the application of available resources, such as financial,
      natural, technological, and human resources. The term "management" may also
      refer to the people who manage an organization.


      Management is also an academic discipline, a social science whose objective
      is to study social organization and organizational leadership. Management is
      studied at colleges and universities; some important degrees in management are
      the Bachelor of Commerce (B.Com.) and Master of Business Administration (M.B.A.)
      and, for the public sector, the Master of Public Administration (MPA) degree.
      Individuals who aim at becoming management researchers or professors may complete
      the Doctor of Management (DM), the Doctor of Business Administration (DBA),
      or the PhD in Business Administration or Management.'

    description: 'The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a nearly
      perfect sphere of hot plasma,[13][14] with internal convective motion that generates
      a magnetic field via a dynamo process.[15] It is by far the most important source
      of energy for life on Earth. Its diameter is about 109 times that of Earth,
      and its mass is about 330,000 times that of Earth, accounting for about 99.86%
      of the total mass of the Solar System.[16] About three quarters of the Sun''s
      mass consists of hydrogen (~73%); the rest is mostly helium (~25%), with much
      smaller quantities of heavier elements, including oxygen, carbon, neon, and
      iron.[17]


      The Sun is a G-type main-sequence star (G2V) based on its spectral class. As
      such, it is informally referred to as a yellow dwarf. It formed approximately
      4.6 billion[a][9][18] years ago from the gravitational collapse of matter within
      a region of a large molecular cloud. Most of this matter gathered in the center,
      whereas the rest flattened into an orbiting disk that became the Solar System.
      The central mass became so hot and dense that it eventually initiated nuclear
      fusion in its core. It is thought that almost all stars form by this process.


      The Sun is roughly middle-aged; it has not changed dramatically for more than
      four billion[a] years, and will remain fairly stable for more than another five
      billion years. After hydrogen fusion in its core has diminished to the point
      at which it is no longer in hydrostatic equilibrium, the core of the Sun will
      experience a marked increase in density and temperature while its outer layers
      expand to eventually become a red giant. It is calculated that the Sun will
      become sufficiently large to engulf the current orbits of Mercury and Venus,
      and render Earth uninhabitable.


      The enormous effect of the Sun on Earth has been recognized since prehistoric
      times, and the Sun has been regarded by some cultures as a deity. The synodic
      rotation of Earth and its orbit around the Sun are the basis of the solar calendar,
      which is the predominant calendar in use today.'

    description: 'Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only object in the
      Universe known to harbor life. According to radiometric dating and other sources
      of evidence, Earth formed over 4 billion years ago.[24][25][26] Earth''s gravity
      interacts with other objects in space, especially the Sun and the Moon, Earth''s
      only natural satellite. During one orbit around the Sun, Earth rotates about
      its axis about 365.26 times; thus, an Earth year is about 365.26 days long.[n
      5]


      Earth''s axis of rotation is tilted, producing seasonal variations on the planet''s
      surface.[27] The gravitational interaction between the Earth and Moon causes
      ocean tides, stabilizes the Earth''s orientation on its axis, and gradually
      slows its rotation.[28] Earth is the densest planet in the Solar System and
      the largest of the four terrestrial planets.


      Earth''s lithosphere is divided into several rigid tectonic plates that migrate
      across the surface over periods of many millions of years. About 71% of Earth''s
      surface is covered with water, mostly by its oceans.[29] The remaining 29% is
      land consisting of continents and islands that together have many lakes, rivers
      and other sources of water that contribute to the hydrosphere. The majority
      of Earth''s polar regions are covered in ice, including the Antarctic ice sheet
      and the sea ice of the Arctic ice pack. Earth''s interior remains active with
      a solid iron inner core, a liquid outer core that generates the Earth''s magnetic
      field, and a convecting mantle that drives plate tectonics.


      Within the first billion years of Earth''s history, life appeared in the oceans
      and began to affect the Earth''s atmosphere and surface, leading to the proliferation
      of aerobic and anaerobic organisms. Some geological evidence indicates that
      life may have arisen as much as 4.1 billion years ago. Since then, the combination
      of Earth''s distance from the Sun, physical properties, and geological history
      have allowed life to evolve and thrive.[30][31] In the history of the Earth,
      biodiversity has gone through long periods of expansion, occasionally punctuated
      by mass extinction events. Over 99% of all species[32] that ever lived on Earth
      are extinct.[33][34] Estimates of the number of species on Earth today vary
      widely;[35][36][37] most species have not been described.[38] Over 7.4 billion
      humans live on Earth and depend on its biosphere and minerals for their survival.
      Humans have developed diverse societies and cultures; politically, the world
      has about 200 sovereign states.'

    description: "Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet\
      \ in the Solar System, after Mercury. Named after the Roman god of war, it is\
      \ often referred to as the \"Red Planet\"[13][14] because the iron oxide prevalent\
      \ on its surface gives it a reddish appearance.[15] Mars is a terrestrial planet\
      \ with a thin atmosphere, having surface features reminiscent both of the impact\
      \ craters of the Moon and the valleys, deserts, and polar ice caps of Earth.\n\
      \nThe rotational period and seasonal cycles of Mars are likewise similar to\
      \ those of Earth, as is the tilt that produces the seasons. Mars is the site\
      \ of Olympus Mons, the largest volcano and second-highest known mountain in\
      \ the Solar System, and of Valles Marineris, one of the largest canyons in the\
      \ Solar System. The smooth Borealis basin in the northern hemisphere covers\
      \ 40% of the planet and may be a giant impact feature.[16][17] Mars has two\
      \ moons, Phobos and Deimos, which are small and irregularly shaped. These may\
      \ be captured asteroids,[18][19] similar to 5261 Eureka, a Mars trojan.\n\n\
      There are ongoing investigations assessing the past habitability potential of\
      \ Mars, as well as the possibility of extant life. Future astrobiology missions\
      \ are planned, including the Mars 2020 and ExoMars rovers.[20][21][22][23] Liquid\
      \ water cannot exist on the surface of Mars due to low atmospheric pressure,\
      \ which is less than 1% of the Earth's,[24] except at the lowest elevations\
      \ for short periods.[25][26] The two polar ice caps appear to be made largely\
      \ of water.[27][28] The volume of water ice in the south polar ice cap, if melted,\
      \ would be sufficient to cover the entire planetary surface to a depth of 11\
      \ meters (36 ft).[29] In November 2016, NASA reported finding a large amount\
      \ of underground ice in the Utopia Planitia region of Mars. The volume of water\
      \ detected has been estimated to be equivalent to the volume of water in Lake\
      \ Superior.[30][31][32]\n\nMars can easily be seen from Earth with the naked\
      \ eye, as can its reddish coloring. Its apparent magnitude reaches \u22122.91,[7]\
      \ which is surpassed only by Jupiter, Venus, the Moon, and the Sun. Optical\
      \ ground-based telescopes are typically limited to resolving features about\
      \ 300 kilometers (190 mi) across when Earth and Mars are closest because of\
      \ Earth's atmosphere.[33]"

      \ ft) underwater on Earth. Venus is by far the hottest planet in the Solar System,\
      \ with a mean surface temperature of 735 K (462 \xB0C; 863 \xB0F), even though\
      \ Mercury is closer to the Sun. Venus is shrouded by an opaque layer of highly\
      \ reflective clouds of sulfuric acid, preventing its surface from being seen\
      \ from space in visible light. It may have had water oceans in the past,[15][16]\
      \ but these would have vaporized as the temperature rose due to a runaway greenhouse\
      \ effect.[17] The water has probably photodissociated, and the free hydrogen\
      \ has been swept into interplanetary space by the solar wind because of the\
      \ lack of a planetary magnetic field.[18] Venus's surface is a dry desertscape\
      \ interspersed with slab-like rocks and is periodically resurfaced by volcanism.\n\
      \nAs one of the brightest objects in the sky, Venus has been a major fixture\
      \ in human culture for as long as records have existed. It has been made sacred\
      \ to gods of many cultures, and has been a prime inspiration for writers and\
      \ poets as the \"morning star\" and \"evening star\". Venus was the first planet\
      \ to have its motions plotted across the sky, as early as the second millennium\
      \ BC.[19]\n\nAs the closest planet to Earth, Venus has been a prime target for\
      \ early interplanetary exploration. It was the first planet beyond Earth visited\
      \ by a spacecraft (Mariner 2 in 1962), and the first to be successfully landed\
      \ on (by Venera 7 in 1970). Venus's thick clouds render observation of its surface\
      \ impossible in visible light, and the first detailed maps did not emerge until\
      \ the arrival of the Magellan orbiter in 1991. Plans have been proposed for\
      \ rovers or more complex missions, but they are hindered by Venus's hostile\
      \ surface conditions."

    description: "Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in\

      \ about nine times that of Earth.[11][12] Although it has only one-eighth the\
      \ average density of Earth, with its larger volume Saturn is just over 95 times\
      \ more massive.[13][14][15] Saturn is named after the Roman god of agriculture;\
      \ its astronomical symbol (\u2644) represents the god's sickle.\n\nSaturn's\
      \ interior is probably composed of a core of iron\u2013nickel and rock (silicon\
      \ and oxygen compounds). This core is surrounded by a deep layer of metallic\
      \ hydrogen, an intermediate layer of liquid hydrogen and liquid helium, and\
      \ finally outside the Frenkel line a gaseous outer layer.[16] Saturn has a pale\
      \ yellow hue due to ammonia crystals in its upper atmosphere. Electrical current\
      \ within the metallic hydrogen layer is thought to give rise to Saturn's planetary\
      \ magnetic field, which is weaker than Earth's, but has a magnetic moment 580\
      \ times that of Earth due to Saturn's larger size. Saturn's magnetic field strength\
      \ is around one-twentieth of Jupiter's.[17] The outer atmosphere is generally\
      \ bland and lacking in contrast, although long-lived features can appear. Wind\
      \ speeds on Saturn can reach 1,800 km/h (500 m/s), higher than on Jupiter, but\
      \ not as high as those on Neptune.[18]\n\nSaturn has a prominent ring system\
      \ that consists of nine continuous main rings and three discontinuous arcs and\
      \ that is composed mostly of ice particles with a smaller amount of rocky debris\
      \ and dust. 62 moons[19] are known to orbit Saturn, of which fifty-three are\
      \ officially named. This does not include the hundreds of moonlets comprising\
      \ the rings. Titan, Saturn's largest moon, and the second-largest in the Solar\
      \ System, is larger than the planet Mercury, although less massive, and is the\
      \ only moon in the Solar System to have a substantial atmosphere.[20]"

    description: "Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the\
      \ Solar System. It is a giant planet with a mass one-thousandth that of the\
      \ Sun, but two and a half times that of all the other planets in the Solar System\
      \ combined. Jupiter and Saturn are gas giants; the other two giant planets,\
      \ Uranus and Neptune are ice giants. Jupiter has been known to astronomers since\
      \ antiquity.[12] The Romans named it after their god Jupiter.[13] When viewed\
      \ from Earth, Jupiter can reach an apparent magnitude of \u22122.94, bright\
      \ enough for its reflected light to cast shadows,[14] and making it on average\
      \ the third-brightest object in the night sky after the Moon and Venus.\n\n\
      Jupiter is primarily composed of hydrogen with a quarter of its mass being helium,\
      \ though helium comprises only about a tenth of the number of molecules. It\
      \ may also have a rocky core of heavier elements,[15] but like the other giant\
      \ planets, Jupiter lacks a well-defined solid surface. Because of its rapid\
      \ rotation, the planet's shape is that of an oblate spheroid (it has a slight\
      \ but noticeable bulge around the equator). The outer atmosphere is visibly\
      \ segregated into several bands at different latitudes, resulting in turbulence\
      \ and storms along their interacting boundaries. A prominent result is the Great\
      \ Red Spot, a giant storm that is known to have existed since at least the 17th\
      \ century when it was first seen by telescope. Surrounding Jupiter is a faint\
      \ planetary ring system and a powerful magnetosphere. Jupiter has at least 69\
      \ moons,[16] including the four large Galilean moons discovered by Galileo Galilei\
      \ in 1610. Ganymede, the largest of these, has a diameter greater than that\
      \ of the planet Mercury.\n\nJupiter has been explored on several occasions by\
      \ robotic spacecraft, most notably during the early Pioneer and Voyager flyby\
      \ missions and later by the Galileo orbiter. In late February 2007, Jupiter\
      \ was visited by the New Horizons probe, which used Jupiter's gravity to increase\
      \ its speed and bend its trajectory en route to Pluto. The latest probe to visit\
      \ the planet is Juno, which entered into orbit around Jupiter on July 4, 2016.[17][18]\
      \ Future targets for exploration in the Jupiter system include the probable\
      \ ice-covered liquid ocean of its moon Europa."

    description: "Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun. It has the third-largest\

      \ is similar in composition to Neptune, and both have different bulk chemical\
      \ composition from that of the larger gas giants Jupiter and Saturn. For this\
      \ reason, scientists often classify Uranus and Neptune as \"ice giants\" to\
      \ distinguish them from the gas giants. Uranus's atmosphere is similar to Jupiter's\
      \ and Saturn's in its primary composition of hydrogen and helium, but it contains\
      \ more \"ices\" such as water, ammonia, and methane, along with traces of other\
      \ hydrocarbons.[12] It is the coldest planetary atmosphere in the Solar System,\
      \ with a minimum temperature of 49 K (\u2212224 \xB0C; \u2212371 \xB0F), and\

      \ rotation is tilted sideways, nearly into the plane of its solar orbit. Its\
      \ north and south poles, therefore, lie where most other planets have their\
      \ equators.[16] In 1986, images from Voyager 2 showed Uranus as an almost featureless\
      \ planet in visible light, without the cloud bands or storms associated with\
      \ the other giant planets.[16] Observations from Earth have shown seasonal change\
      \ and increased weather activity as Uranus approached its equinox in 2007. Wind\
      \ speeds can reach 250 metres per second (900 km/h; 560 mph).[17]"

    description: "Neptune is the eighth and farthest known planet from the Sun in\
      \ the Solar System. In the Solar System, it is the fourth-largest planet by\
      \ diameter, the third-most-massive planet, and the densest giant planet. Neptune\
      \ is 17 times the mass of Earth and is slightly more massive than its near-twin\
      \ Uranus, which is 15 times the mass of Earth and slightly larger than Neptune.[d]\
      \ Neptune orbits the Sun once every 164.8 years at an average distance of 30.1\
      \ astronomical units (4.50\xD7109 km). It is named after the Roman god of the\
      \ sea and has the astronomical symbol \u2646, a stylised version of the god\
      \ Neptune's trident.\n\nNeptune is not visible to the unaided eye and is the\
      \ only planet in the Solar System found by mathematical prediction rather than\
      \ by empirical observation. Unexpected changes in the orbit of Uranus led Alexis\
      \ Bouvard to deduce that its orbit was subject to gravitational perturbation\
      \ by an unknown planet. Neptune was subsequently observed with a telescope on\
      \ 23 September 1846[1] by Johann Galle within a degree of the position predicted\
      \ by Urbain Le Verrier. Its largest moon, Triton, was discovered shortly thereafter,\
      \ though none of the planet's remaining known 14 moons were located telescopically\
      \ until the 20th century. The planet's distance from Earth gives it a very small\
      \ apparent size, making it challenging to study with Earth-based telescopes.\
      \ Neptune was visited by Voyager 2, when it flew by the planet on 25 August\
      \ 1989.[11] The advent of the Hubble Space Telescope and large ground-based\
      \ telescopes with adaptive optics has recently allowed for additional detailed\
      \ observations from afar.\n\nLike Jupiter and Saturn, Neptune's atmosphere is\
      \ composed primarily of hydrogen and helium, along with traces of hydrocarbons\
      \ and possibly nitrogen, but it contains a higher proportion of \"ices\" such\
      \ as water, ammonia, and methane. However, its interior, like that of Uranus,\
      \ is primarily composed of ices and rock,[12] which is why Uranus and Neptune\
      \ are normally considered \"ice giants\" to emphasise this distinction.[13]\
      \ Traces of methane in the outermost regions in part account for the planet's\
      \ blue appearance.[14]\n\nIn contrast to the hazy, relatively featureless atmosphere\
      \ of Uranus, Neptune's atmosphere has active and visible weather patterns. For\
      \ example, at the time of the Voyager 2 flyby in 1989, the planet's southern\
      \ hemisphere had a Great Dark Spot comparable to the Great Red Spot on Jupiter.\
      \ These weather patterns are driven by the strongest sustained winds of any\
      \ planet in the Solar System, with recorded wind speeds as high as 2,100 kilometres\
      \ per hour (580 m/s; 1,300 mph).[15] Because of its great distance from the\
      \ Sun, Neptune's outer atmosphere is one of the coldest places in the Solar\
      \ System, with temperatures at its cloud tops approaching 55 K (\u2212218 \xB0\
      C). Temperatures at the planet's centre are approximately 5,400 K (5,100 \xB0\
      C).[16][17] Neptune has a faint and fragmented ring system (labelled \"arcs\"\
      ), which was discovered in 1982, then later confirmed by Voyager 2.[18]"

      to the oceanic dolphin family, of which it is the largest member. Killer whales
      have a diverse diet, although individual populations often specialize in particular

      that preys on them. Killer whales are considered a cosmopolitan species, and
      can be found in each of the world''s oceans in a variety of marine environments,
      from Arctic and Antarctic regions to tropical seas.


      Killer whales are highly social; some populations are composed of matrilineal
      family groups (pods) which are the most stable of any animal species.[5] Their
      sophisticated hunting techniques and vocal behaviours, which are often specific

    description: "The gray wolf or grey wolf (Canis lupus),[a] also known as the timber\
      \ wolf[3][4] or western wolf,[b] is a canine native to the wilderness and remote\
      \ areas of Eurasia and North America. It is the largest extant member of its\
      \ family, with males averaging 43\u201345 kg (95\u201399 lb) and females 36\u2013\
      38.5 kg (79\u201385 lb).[6] Like the red wolf, it is distinguished from other\
      \ Canis species by its larger size and less pointed features, particularly on\
      \ the ears and muzzle.[7] Its winter fur is long and bushy and predominantly\
      \ a mottled gray in color, although nearly pure white, red, and brown to black\
      \ also occur.[4] As of 2005,[8] 37 subspecies of C. lupus are recognised by\
      \ MSW3.\n\nThe gray wolf is the second most specialised member of the genus\
      \ Canis, after the Ethiopian wolf, as demonstrated by its morphological adaptations\
      \ to hunting large prey, its more gregarious nature,[9] and its highly advanced\
      \ expressive behavior.[10][11] It is nonetheless closely related enough to smaller\
      \ Canis species, such as the eastern wolf,[5] coyote,[12] and golden jackal,[13][14]\
      \ to produce fertile hybrids. It is the only species of Canis to have a range\
      \ encompassing both the Old and New Worlds,[5] and originated in Eurasia during\
      \ the Pleistocene, colonizing North America on at least three separate occasions\
      \ during the Rancholabrean.[5] It is a social animal, travelling in nuclear\
      \ families consisting of a mated pair, accompanied by the pair's adult offspring.[15]\
      \ The gray wolf is typically an apex predator throughout its range, with only\
      \ humans and tigers[9][16][17][18] posing a serious threat to it. It feeds primarily\
      \ on large ungulates, though it also eats smaller animals, livestock, carrion,\
      \ and garbage.[4]"

      \ denotes the several subspecies in Africa. With some males exceeding 250 kg\
      \ (550 lb) in weight,[5] it is the second-largest living cat after the tiger,\
      \ barring hybrids like the liger.[6][7] Wild lions currently exist in sub-Saharan\
      \ Africa and in India (where an endangered remnant population resides in and\
      \ around Gir Forest National Park). In ancient historic times, their range was\
      \ in most of Africa, including North Africa, and across Eurasia from Greece\
      \ and southeastern Europe to India. In the late Pleistocene, about 10,000 years\
      \ ago, the lion was the most widespread large land mammal after humans: Panthera\
      \ leo spelaea lived in northern and western Europe and Panthera leo atrox lived\
      \ in the Americas from the Yukon to Peru.[8] The lion is classified as a vulnerable\

      \ seen a major population decline in its African range of 30\u201350% over two\
      \ decades during the second half of the twentieth century.[3] Lion populations\
      \ are untenable outside designated reserves and national parks. Although the\
      \ cause of the decline is not fully understood, habitat loss and conflicts with\
      \ humans are the greatest causes of concern. Within Africa, the West African\

    description: 'From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

      This article is about determination of position and direction on or above the
      surface of the earth. For other uses, see Navigation (disambiguation).


      Table of geography, hydrography, and navigation, from the 1728 Cyclopaedia

      Navigation is a field of study that focuses on the process of monitoring and
      controlling the movement of a craft or vehicle from one place to another.[1]
      The field of navigation includes four general categories: land navigation, marine
      navigation, aeronautic navigation, and space navigation.[2]


      It is also the term of art used for the specialized knowledge used by navigators
      to perform navigation tasks. All navigational techniques involve locating the
      navigator''s position compared to known locations or patterns.


      Navigation, in a broader sense, can refer to any skill or study that involves
      the determination of position and direction.[2] In this sense, navigation includes
      orienteering and pedestrian navigation.[2] For information about different navigation
      strategies that people use, visit human navigation.'

    description: "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\nFor satellite navigation\
      \ in automobile navigation systems, see Automotive navigation system.\nA satellite\
      \ navigation or satnav system is a system that uses satellites to provide autonomous\
      \ geo-spatial positioning. It allows small electronic receivers to determine\
      \ their location (longitude, latitude, and altitude/elevation) to high precision\
      \ (within a few metres) using time signals transmitted along a line of sight\
      \ by radio from satellites. The system can be used for providing position, navigation\
      \ or for tracking the position of something fitted with a receiver (satellite\
      \ tracking). The signals also allow the electronic receiver to calculate the\
      \ current local time to high precision, which allows time synchronisation. Satnav\
      \ systems operate independently of any telephonic or internet reception, though\
      \ these technologies can enhance the usefulness of the positioning information\
      \ generated.\n\nA satellite navigation system with global coverage may be termed\
      \ a global navigation satellite system (GNSS). As of December 2016 only the\
      \ United States NAVSTAR Global Positioning System (GPS), the Russian GLONASS\
      \ and the European Union's Galileo are global operational GNSSs. The European\
      \ Union's Galileo GNSS is scheduled to be fully operational by 2020.[1] China\
      \ is in the process of expanding its regional BeiDou Navigation Satellite System\
      \ into the global BeiDou-2 GNSS by 2020.[2] France, India and Japan are in the\
      \ process of developing regional navigation and augmentation systems as well.\n\
      \nGlobal coverage for each system is generally achieved by a satellite constellation\
      \ of 18\u201330 medium Earth orbit (MEO) satellites spread between several orbital\
      \ planes. The actual systems vary, but use orbital inclinations of >50\xB0 and\
      \ orbital periods of roughly twelve hours (at an altitude of about 20,000 kilometres\
      \ or 12,000 miles)."

      directed, and co-produced by Kevin Smith. Starring Brian O'Halloran as Dante
      Hicks and Jeff Anderson as Randal Graves, it presents a day in the lives of
      two store clerks and their acquaintances. Shot entirely in black-and-white,
      Clerks is the first of Smith's View Askewniverse films, and introduces several
      recurring characters, notably Jay and Silent Bob, the latter played by Smith
      himself. The structure of the movie contains nine scene breaks, signifying the
      nine rings of hell as in Dante Alighieri's Divine Comedy, from which the main
      character, Dante, gets his name.

    description: 'Mallrats is a 1995 American comedy film written and directed by
      Kevin Smith. It is the second film in the View Askewniverse after 1994''s Clerks.


      As in the other View Askewniverse films, the characters Jay and Silent Bob feature
      prominently, and characters and events from other films are discussed. Several
      cast members, including Jason Lee, Ben Affleck, and Joey Lauren Adams, have
      gone on to work in several other Smith films. Comic book icon Stan Lee appeared,
      as did Brian O''Halloran, the star of Smith''s breakout feature Clerks.


      Plans for a sequel, MallBrats, were announced in March 2015. In June 2016, Smith
      announced that the sequel would instead be a 10-episode TV series; in February
      2017, Smith announced that he had not been able to sell the TV series to any
      network, and the sequel was shelved indefinitely.'

    description: 'Chasing Amy is a 1997 American romantic comedy-drama film written
      and directed by Kevin Smith. The film is about a male comic artist who falls
      in love with a lesbian woman, to the displeasure of his best friend. It is the
      third film in Smith''s View Askewniverse series.


      The film was originally inspired by a brief scene from an early movie by a friend
      of Smith''s. In Guinevere Turner''s Go Fish, one of the lesbian characters imagines
      her friends passing judgment on her for "selling out" by sleeping with a man.
      Kevin Smith was dating star Joey Lauren Adams at the time he was writing the
      script, which was also partly inspired by her.[3]


      The film won two awards at the 1998 Independent Spirit Awards (Best Screenplay
      for Smith and Best Supporting Actor for Jason Lee).'

    description: 'Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back is a 2001 American comedy film written
      and directed by Kevin Smith, the fifth to be set in his View Askewniverse, a
      growing collection of characters and settings that developed out of his cult
      favorite Clerks. It focuses on the two eponymous characters, played respectively
      by Jason Mewes and Smith. The film features a large number of cameo appearances
      by famous actors and directors, and its title and logo for Jay and Silent Bob
      Strike Back are direct references to The Empire Strikes Back.


      Originally intended to be the last film set in the Askewniverse, or to feature
      Jay and Silent Bob, Strike Back features many characters from the previous Askew
      films, some in dual roles and reprising roles from the previous entries. The
      film was a minor commercial success, grossing $33.8 million worldwide from a
      $22 million budget, and received mixed reviews from critics.


      Five years later and following the commercial failure of Jersey Girl, Smith
      reconsidered and decided to continue the series with Clerks II, resurrecting
      Jay and Silent Bob in supporting roles. Smith announced in February 2017 that
      he was writing a sequel called Jay and Silent Bob Reboot and hoped to start
      filming in summer 2017.'

    description: 'Brisket can be cooked many ways, including baking, boiling and roasting.
      Basting of the meat is often done during the cooking process. This normally
      tough cut of meat, due to the collagen fibers that make up the significant connective
      tissue in the cut, is tenderized when the collagen gelatinizes, resulting in
      more tender brisket. The fat cap, which is often left attached to the brisket,
      helps to keep the meat from drying during the prolonged cooking necessary to
      break down the connective tissue in the meat. Water is necessary for the conversion
      of collagen to gelatin, which is the hydrolysis product of collagen.


      Popular methods in the United States include rubbing with a spice rub or marinating
      the meat, then cooking slowly over indirect heat from charcoal or wood. This
      is a form of smoking the meat. A hardwood, such as oak, pecan, hickory, or mesquite,
      is sometimes added, alone or in combination with other hardwoods, to the main
      heat source. Sometimes, they make up all of the heat source, with chefs often
      prizing characteristics of certain woods. The smoke from these woods and from
      burnt dripping juices further enhances the flavor. The finished meat is a variety
      of barbecue. Smoked brisket done this way is popular in Texas barbecue. Once
      finished, pieces of brisket can be returned to the smoker to make burnt ends.
      Burnt ends are most popular in Kansas City-style barbecue, where they are traditionally
      served open-faced on white bread. The traditional New England boiled dinner
      features brisket as a main course option. Brisket is also cooked in a slow cooker
      as this also tenderizes the meat due to the slow cooking method, which is usually
      8 hours for a 3lb brisket.'

      Bow Brewery, on the Middlesex-Essex border. Bow Brewery beers became popular
      among East India Company traders in the late 18th century because of the brewery''s
      location near the East India Docks. Demand for the export style of pale ale,
      which had become known as India pale ale, developed in England around 1840 and
      it later became a popular product there.[4][5] IPAs have a long history in Canada
      and the United States, and many breweries there produce a version of the style.'

    description: is one of two extant subspecies of Equus ferus. It is an odd-toed
      ungulate mammal belonging to the taxonomic family Equidae. The horse has evolved
      over the past 45 to 55 million years from a small multi-toed creature, Eohippus,
      into the large, single-toed animal of today. Humans began to domesticate horses
      around 4000 BC, and their domestication is believed to have been widespread
      by 3000 BC. Horses in the subspecies caballus are domesticated, although some
      domesticated populations live in the wild as feral horses. These feral populations
      are not true wild horses, as this term is used to describe horses that have
      never been domesticated, such as the endangered Przewalski's horse, a separate
      subspecies, and the only remaining true wild horse. There is an extensive, specialized
      vocabulary used to describe equine-related concepts, covering everything from
      anatomy to life stages, size, colors, markings, breeds, locomotion, and behavior.

    description: 'Stout is a dark beer made using roasted malt or roasted barley,
      hops, water and yeast. Stouts were traditionally the generic term for the strongest
      or stoutest porters, typically 7% or 8%, produced by a brewery.[1][2] There
      are a number of variations including Baltic porter, milk stout, and imperial
      stout; the most common variation is dry stout, exemplified by Guinness Draught,
      the world''s best selling stout.[citation needed]


      The first known use of the word stout for beer was in a document dated 1677
      found in the Egerton Manuscript, the sense being that a stout beer was a strong
      beer not a dark beer.[3] The name porter was first used in 1721 to describe
      a dark brown beer that had been made with roasted malts. Because of the huge
      popularity of porters, brewers made them in a variety of strengths. The stronger
      beers were called "stout porters", so the history and development of stout and
      porter are intertwined, and the term stout has become firmly associated with
      dark beer, rather than just strong beer.'

    description: 'Moonshine was originally a slang term used to describe high-proof
      distilled spirits usually produced illicitly, without government authorization.
      In recent years, however, moonshine has been legalized in various countries
      and has become a term of art. Legal in the United States since 2010, moonshine
      is defined as "clear, unaged whiskey".


      In the United States, moonshine is typically made with corn mash as its main
      ingredient. Liquor-control laws in the United States that prohibit moonshining,
      once consisting of a total ban under the 18th Amendment of the Constitution,
      now focus on evasion of revenue taxation on spiritous or intoxicating liquors.
      They are enforced by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives
      of the US Department of Justice; such enforcers of these laws are known by the
      often derisive nickname of "revenooers."'

      \ around 240\u2013280 \xB0F or 115\u2013145 \xB0C\u2014and significantly longer\
      \ cooking times (several hours), known as smoking. Another technique, known\
      \ as baking, used a masonry oven or baking oven that uses convection to cook\
      \ meats and starches with moderate temperatures for an average cooking time\
      \ of about an hour. Braising combines direct, dry heat charbroiling on a ribbed\
      \ surface with a broth-filled pot for moist heat. Using this technique, cooking\
      \ occurs at various speeds, starting fast, slowing down, then speeding up again,\
      \ lasting for a few hours.[27][28]\n\nGrilling is done over direct, dry heat,\
      \ usually over a hot fire over 500 \xB0F (260 \xB0C) for a few minutes. Grilling\
      \ may be done over wood, charcoal, gas, or electricity. The time difference\
      \ between barbecuing and grilling is because of the temperature difference;\
      \ at low temperatures used for barbecuing, meat takes several hours to reach\
      \ the desired internal temperature.[29][30]\nSmoking\nMain article: Smoking\
      \ (cooking)\nChicken, pork and bacon-wrapped corn cooked in a barbecue smoker\n\
      \nSmoking is the process of flavoring, cooking, and/or preserving food by exposing\
      \ it to smoke from burning or smoldering material, most often wood. Meat and\
      \ fish are the most common smoked foods, though cheeses, vegetables, nuts, and\
      \ ingredients used to make beverages such as beer or smoked beer are also smoked.[31][full\
      \ citation needed]\nRoasting\nSee also: Pit barbecue\n\nThe masonry oven is\
      \ similar to a smoke pit; it allows for an open flame but cooks more quickly\
      \ and uses convection to cook. Barbecue-baking can also be done in traditional\
      \ stove-ovens. It can be used to cook meats, breads and other starches, casseroles,\
      \ and desserts. It uses direct and indirect heat to surround the food with hot\
      \ air to cook, and can be basted in much the same manner as grilled foods.[32]\n\
      Braising\n\nIt is possible to braise meats and vegetables in a pot on top of\

      \ combining dry heat charbroil-grilling directly on a ribbed surface and braising\
      \ in a broth-filled pot for moist heat. The pot is placed on top of the grill,\
      \ covered, and allowed to simmer for a few hours. There are two advantages to\
      \ barbecue-braising; it allows browning of the meat directly on the grill before\
      \ the braising. It also allows for glazing of meat with sauce and finishing\
      \ it directly over the fire after the braising. This effectively cooks the meat\
      \ three times, which results in a soft, textured product that falls off the\
      \ bone. The time needed for braising varies depending on whether a slow cooker\
      \ or pressure cooker is used; it is generally slower than regular grilling or\
      \ baking, but quicker than pit-smoking.[citation needed]"

    requirements: 'Smoking

      Smoking is the process of flavoring, cooking, and/or preserving food by exposing
      it to smoke from burning or smoldering material, most often wood. Meat and fish
      are the most common smoked foods, though cheeses, vegetables, nuts, and ingredients
      used to make beverages such as beer or smoked beer are also smoked.[31][full
      citation needed]

      Roasting


      The masonry oven is similar to a smoke pit; it allows for an open flame but
      cooks more quickly and uses convection to cook. Barbecue-baking can also be
      done in traditional stove-ovens. It can be used to cook meats, breads and other
      starches, casseroles, and desserts. It uses direct and indirect heat to surround
      the food with hot air to cook, and can be basted in much the same manner as
      grilled foods.[32]'

    description: 'Stroke play, also known as medal play, is a scoring system in the
      sport of golf. It involves counting the total number of strokes taken on each
      hole during a given round, or series of rounds. The winner is the player who
      has taken the fewest strokes over the course of the round, or rounds.


      Although most professional tournaments are played using the stroke play scoring
      system, there are, or have been, some notable exceptions, for example the WGC-Accenture
      Match Play Championship and Volvo World Match Play Championship, which are both
      played in a match play format, and The International, a former PGA Tour event
      that used a modified stableford system. Most team events, for example the Ryder
      Cup, are also contested using the match play format.'

    requirements: 'Most tournaments enforce a cut, which in a typical 72-hole tournament
      is done after 36 holes. The number of players who "make the cut" depends on
      the tournament rules - in a typical PGA Tour event the top 70 professionals
      (plus ties) after 36 holes. Any player who turns in a score higher than the
      "cut line" will "miss the cut" and take no further part in the tournament.


      Count back:

      One method commonly used in amateur competitions, especially when a playoff
      is not practicable, is a scorecard "count back", whereby comparing scores hole
      by hole starting with 17, then 16 and so on... the first player with a lower
      score is declared the loser. This ensures that the player who was in the lead
      before the tie occurred is declared the winner. To put it another way, to win
      a tournament one must equal and then pass the leader...not merely catch up to
      him.'

      desktop environment and associated application software from the physical client
      device that is used to access it.


      Desktop virtualization can be used in conjunction with application virtualization
      and user profile management systems, now termed "user virtualization," to provide
      a comprehensive desktop environment management system. In this mode, all the
      components of the desktop are virtualized, which allows for a highly flexible
      and much more secure desktop delivery model. In addition, this approach supports
      a more complete desktop disaster recovery strategy as all components are essentially
      saved in the data center and backed up through traditional redundant maintenance
      systems. If a user''s device or hardware is lost, the restore is straightforward
      and simple, because the components will be present at login from another device.
      In addition, because no data is saved to the user''s device, if that device
      is lost, there is much less chance that any critical data can be retrieved and
      compromised.'

      learning (vertical axis) with experience (horizontal axis).

      A learning curve averaged over many trials is smooth, and can be expressed as
      a mathematical function

      The term learning curve is used in two main ways: where the same task is repeated
      in a series of trials, or where a body of knowledge is learned over time. The
      first person to describe the learning curve was Hermann Ebbinghaus in 1885,
      in the field of the psychology of learning, although the name wasn''t used until
      1909

      The familiar expression "a steep learning curve" is intended to mean that the
      activity is difficult to learn, although a learning curve with a steep start
      actually represents rapid progress'

      console capable of displaying stereoscopic 3D graphics. The player uses the
      console in a manner similar to a head-mounted display, placing their head against
      the eyepiece to see a red monochrome display. The games use a parallax effect
      to create the illusion of depth. Sales failed to meet targets, and by early
      1996, Nintendo ceased distribution and game development, only ever releasing
      22 games for the system.

    description: 'From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


      Traditional Polynesian navigation was used for thousands of years to make long
      voyages across thousands of miles of the open Pacific Ocean. Navigators travelled
      to small inhabited islands using wayfinding techniques and knowledge passed
      by oral tradition from master to apprentice, often in the form of song. Generally
      each island maintained a guild of navigators who had very high status; in times
      of famine or difficulty they could trade for aid or evacuate people to neighboring
      islands. As of 2014, these traditional navigation methods are still taught in
      the Polynesian outlier of Taumako Island in the Solomons.


      Polynesian navigation used some navigational instruments, which predate and
      are distinct from the machined metal tools used by European navigators (such
      as the sextant, first produced 1730, sea astrolabe, ~late 15th century, and
      marine chronometer, invented 1761). However, they also relied heavily on close
      observation of sea sign and a large body of knowledge from oral tradition.[1]


      Both wayfinding techniques and outrigger canoe construction methods have been
      kept as guild secrets, but in the modern revival of these skills, they are being
      recorded and published.'

      \ canoe built in Kawaihae, Hawaii by members of Na Kalai Wa\u02BBa Moku o Hawai\u02BB\
      i and \u02BBOhana Wa'a members from throughout the Pacific and abroad as a gift\
      \ and tribute to Satawalese navigator Mau Piailug, who navigated the voyaging\
      \ canoe H\u014Dk\u016Ble\u02BBa on her maiden voyage to Tahiti in 1976 and has\
      \ since trained numerous native Hawaiians in the ancient art of wayfinding.\
      \ The word maisu in the name of the canoe comes from the Satawalese word for\
      \ breadfruit. In particular, the word refers to breadfruit that has been knocked\
      \ down by storm winds and is therefore available for anyone to take. The name\
      \ is said to symbolize the knowledge of navigation that is made freely available.[1]\n\
      \nThe concept for Alingano Maisu came about in 2001 when two Hawaiian voyaging\
      \ groups, the Polynesian Voyaging Society and Na Kalai Wa\u02BBa Moku o Hawai\u02BB\
      i, met with Piailug. The two hulls of the 56-foot (17 m) vessel were fabricated\
      \ by the Friends of H\u014Dk\u016Ble\u02BBa and Hawai\u02BBiloa on O\u02BBahu\
      \ and shipped to the Island of Hawai\u02BBi where Na Kalai Wa\u02BBa completed\
      \ construction of the canoe. The Polynesian Voyaging Society provided much of\
      \ the funding for the voyaging aspect of the project as well as an escort boat\
      \ to help sail the canoe to Satawal.[2]\n\nThe canoe is home-ported on the island\
      \ of Yap under the command of Piailug's son, Sesario Sewralur.[3]"

      Not to be confused with Siemens Mobile.


      Siemens Mobility is a division of the German conglomerate Siemens. Prior to
      the corporate restructuring of Siemens AG (effective from 1 January 2008) Siemens
      Transportation Systems was the operational division most closely related to
      Siemens Mobility; products produced included automation and power systems, rolling
      stock for mass-transit, railway signalling and control systems, and railway
      electrification.


      The group also incorporates the former railway rolling stock and locomotive
      division Siemens Schienenfahrzeugtechnik (Siemens Railway Technology).'

      by Grote in 1882.[1] It is found in North America, where it has been recorded
      from Alaska, British Columbia, California, Montana and Washington.[2][3]


      The wingspan is about 21 mm. The forewings are white with a dark brown band
      from the middle of the costa half-way to the inner margin. The antemedial and
      postmedial lines are broken and indistinct and there are black spots along the
      outer margin and the distal half of the costa. There is also pale yellowish
      shading in the median area. The hindwings are white with a diffuse yellowish
      terminal band and black dots along the outer margin. Adults are on wing from
      May to August.[4]'

    description: A postage stamp is a small piece of paper that is purchased and displayed
      on an item of mail as evidence of payment of postage. Typically, stamps are
      printed on special custom-made paper, show a national designation and a denomination
      (value) on the front, and have an adhesive gum on the back or are self-adhesive.
      Postage stamps are purchased from a postal administration (post office) or other
      authorized vendor, and are used to pay for the costs involved in moving mail,
      as well as other business necessities such as insurance and registration. They
      are sometimes a source of net profit to the issuing agency, especially when
      sold to collectors who will not actually use them for postage.

      SimpleText allows editing including text formatting (underline, italic, bold,
      etc.), fonts, and sizes. It was developed to integrate the features included
      in the different versions of TeachText that were created by various software
      development groups within Apple.[2]


      It can be considered similar to Windows'' WordPad application. In later versions
      it also gained additional read only display capabilities for PICT files, as
      well as other Mac OS built-in formats like Quickdraw GX and QTIF, 3DMF and even
      QuickTime movies.[2] SimpleText can even record short sound samples and, using
      Apple''s PlainTalk speech system, read out text in English. Users who wanted
      to add sounds longer than 24 seconds, however, needed to use a separate program
      to create the sound and then paste the desired sound into the document using
      ResEdit.[2]'

    description: Soterosanthus shepheardii is a species of orchid found in Ecuador
      and Colombia,[1] and the only species of the monotypic genus Soterosanthus.
      This species segregated from Sievekingia because of its upright inflorescence.
      Flowers are somewhat similar to Sievekingia as is the plant stature, being on
      the small side, around 6" tall. Plants are semi-deciduous and warmth tolerant.
      Grow in small pots of medium grade bark mix under same conditions as for Gongora;
      shaded light, even moisture, drier in winter. It is a rarely seen relative of
      Stanhopea.[2][3][4]

    description: Minesweeper is a single-player puzzle video game. The objective of
      the game is to clear a rectangular board containing hidden "mines" or bombs
      without detonating any of them, with help from clues about the number of neighboring
      mines in each field. The game originates from the 1960s, and has been written
      for many computing platforms in use today. It has many variations and offshoots.

    description: 'The Office Assistant was an intelligent user interface for Microsoft
      Office that assisted users by way of an interactive animated character, which
      interfaced with the Office help content. It was included in Microsoft Office
      for Windows (versions 97 to 2003), in Microsoft Publisher (versions 98 to 2003),
      and Microsoft Office for Mac (versions 98 to 2004).


      The default assistant in the English Windows version was named Clippit (commonly
      nicknamed Clippy), after a paperclip.[1][2] The character was designed by Kevan
      J. Atteberry.[2] Clippit was the default and by far the most notable Assistant
      (partly because in many cases the setup CD was required to install the other
      assistants), which also led to it being called simply the Microsoft Paperclip.[3]
      The original Clippit in Office 97 was given a new look in Office 2000.'

    description: 'Phylo is an experimental video game about multiple sequence alignment
      optimisation.[1] Developed by the McGill Centre for Bioinformatics, it was originally
      released as a free Flash game in November 2010. Designed as a game with a purpose,
      players solve pattern-matching puzzles that represent nucleotide sequences of
      different phylogenetic taxa to optimize alignments over a computer algorithm.
      By aligning together each nucleotide sequence, represented as differently coloured
      blocks, players attempt to create the highest point value score for each set
      of sequences by matching as many colours as possible and minimizing gaps.


      The nucleotide sequences generated by Phylo are obtained from actual sequence
      data from the UCSC Genome Browser. High-scoring player alignments are collected
      as data and sent back to the McGill Centre for Bioinformatics to be further
      evaluated with a stronger scoring algorithm. Those player alignments that score
      higher than the current computer-generated score will be re-introduced into
      the global alignment as an optimization.'

    description: 'Fight Club is a 1999 American film based on the 1996 novel of the
      same name by Chuck Palahniuk. The film was directed by David Fincher, and stars
      Brad Pitt, Edward Norton and Helena Bonham Carter. Norton plays the unnamed
      protagonist, referred to as the narrator, who is discontented with his white-collar
      job. He forms a "fight club" with soap maker Tyler Durden, played by Pitt, and
      they are joined by men who also want to fight recreationally. The narrator becomes
      embroiled in a relationship with Durden and a dissolute woman, Marla Singer,
      played by Bonham Carter.


      Palahniuk''s novel was optioned by 20th Century Fox producer Laura Ziskin, who
      hired Jim Uhls to write the film adaptation. Fincher was one of four directors
      the producers considered, and was selected because of his enthusiasm for the
      film. Fincher developed the script with Uhls and sought screenwriting advice
      from the cast and others in the film industry. The director and the cast compared
      the film to Rebel Without a Cause (1955) and The Graduate (1967). They said
      its theme was the conflict between a generation of young people and the value
      system of advertising.[4][5] The director copied the homoerotic overtones from
      Palahniuk''s novel to make audiences uncomfortable and keep them from anticipating
      the twist ending.[6]'

      \ the player controls the main character from an overhead perspective, and the\
      \ controls are largely the same as those of previous games. As with previous\
      \ games, the main objectives are to catch all of the Pokemon in the games\
      \ and defeat the Elite Four (a group of Pokemon trainers); also like their\
      \ predecessors, the games' main subplot involves the main character defeating\
      \ a criminal organization that attempts to take over the region. New features,\
      \ such as double battles and Pokemon abilities along with 135 new Poke\
      mon, have been added. As the Game Boy Advance is more powerful than its predecessors,\
      \ four players may be connected at a time instead of the previous limit of two.\
      \ Additionally, the games can be connected to an e-Reader or other advanced\
      \ generation Pokemon games."

      \ Many species of salmon have been introduced into non-native environments such\
      \ as the Great Lakes of North America and Patagonia in South America. Salmon\

      \ to fresh water to reproduce. However, populations of several species are restricted\
      \ to fresh water through their lives. Various species of salmon display anadromous\
      \ life strategies while others display freshwater resident life strategies.\
      \ Folklore has it that the fish return to the exact spot where they were born\
      \ to spawn; tracking studies have shown this to be mostly true. A portion of\

    description: 'Bass fishing is the activity of angling for the North American gamefish
      known colloquially as the black bass.[1] There are numerous black bass species
      considered as gamefish in North America, including largemouth bass (Micropterus
      salmoides), smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieui), spotted bass or Kentucky
      bass (Micropterus punctulatus), and Guadalupe bass (order Perciformes).[2]


      Modern bass fishing has evolved into a multibillion-dollar industry.[3] The
      sport has changed drastically since its beginnings in the late 19th century.
      From humble beginnings, the black bass has become the most specifically sought-after
      game fish in the United States.[4] The sport has driven the development of all
      manner of fishing gear, including rods, reels, lines, lures, electronic depth
      and fish-finding instruments, drift boats, float tubes, also boats specified
      for bass fishing.'

    description: "There are many types of fishing lures. In most cases they are manufactured\
      \ to resemble prey for the fish, but they are sometimes engineered to appeal\
      \ to a fishes' sense of territory, curiosity or aggression. Most lures are made\
      \ to look like dying, injured, or fast moving fish. They include the following\
      \ types:\n\n    A jig is a weighted hook with a lead head opposite the sharp\
      \ tip. They usually have a minnow or crawfish or even a plastic worm on it to\
      \ get the fish's attention. Deep water jigs used in saltwater fishing consist\
      \ of a large metallic weight, which gives the impression of the body of the\
      \ bait fish, which has a hook attached via a short length of kevlar usually\
      \ to the top of the jig. Some jigs can be fished in water depths down to 300\
      \ metres.\n    Surface lures are also known as top water lures, poppers and\
      \ stickbaits. They float and look like fish prey that is on top of the water.\
      \ They can make a popping, burbling, or even a buzzing sound. It takes a long\
      \ time to learn how to use this lure effectively\n    Spoon lures usually look\
      \ like a spoon, with a wide rounded end and a narrower pointed end, similar\
      \ n shape to a concave spearhead. They flash in the light while wobbling and\
      \ darting due to their shape, which attracts fish.\n    LED lures have a built\
      \ in led and battery to attract fish. They use a flashing or sometimes strobing\
      \ pattern, using a combination of colors and leds.[2]\n    Plugs are also known\
      \ as crankbaits or minnows. These lures look like fish and they are run through\
      \ the water where they can move in different ways because of instability due\
      \ to the bib at the front under the head.\n    Artificial flies are designed\
      \ to resemble all manner of fish prey and are used with a fly rod and reel in\
      \ fly fishing.[3]\n    Soft plastic baits are lures made of plastic or rubber\
      \ designed to look like fish, crabs, squid, worms, lizards, frogs, leeches and\
      \ other creatures.\n    Spinnerbait are pieces of wire that are bent at about\
      \ a 60 degree angle with a hook at the bottom and a flashy spinner at the top.\n\
      \    Swimbait is a soft plastic bait/lure that resembles an actual bait fish.\
      \ Some of these have a tail that makes the lure/bait look like it is swimming\
      \ when drawn through the water.\n    Fish decoy is a type of lure that traditionally\
      \ was carved to resemble a fish, frog, small rodent, or an insect that lures\
      \ in fish so they can be speared. They are often used through the ice by fishermen\
      \ and also by the Inuit people as part of their diet. The Mitchell Museum of\
      \ the American Indian collection includes Native American fish decoys. William\
      \ Jesse Ramey is considered a vintage master carver of fish decoys, and his\
      \ work has been featured in museums.[4]\n    Combined lures combine properties\
      \ of several different types of lures."
    description_short: The fishing lure is either tied with a knot, or connected with
      a "swivel" onto the fishing line.

    requirements: A fishing lure is a type of artificial fishing bait which is designed
      to attract a fish's attention. The lure uses movement, vibration, flash and
      color to bait fish. Many lures are equipped with one or more hooks that are
      used to catch fish when they strike the lure. Some lures are placed to attract
      fish so a spear can be impaled into the fish or so the fish can be captured
      by hand. Most lures are attached to the end of a fishing line and have various
      styles of hooks attached to the body and are designed to elicit a strike resulting
      in a hookset. Many lures are commercially made but some are hand made such as
      fishing flies. Hand tying fly lures to match the hatch is considered a challenge
      by many amateur entomologists.

    description: Morse code is a method of transmitting text information as a series
      of on-off tones, lights, or clicks that can be directly understood by a skilled
      listener or observer without special equipment. It is named for Samuel F. B.
      Morse, an inventor of the telegraph. The International Morse Code[1] encodes
      the ISO basic Latin alphabet, some extra Latin letters, the Arabic numerals
      and a small set of punctuation and procedural signals (prosigns) as standardized
      sequences of short and long signals called "dots" and "dashes",[1] or "dits"
      and "dahs", as in amateur radio practice. Because many non-English natural languages
      use more than the 26 Roman letters, extensions to the Morse alphabet exist for
      those languages.

      team plays its home games at M&T Bank Stadium and is headquartered in Owings

      The Ravens were established in 1996, when Art Modell, who was then the owner
      of the Cleveland Browns, announced plans to relocate the franchise from Cleveland
      to Baltimore.[6] As part of a settlement between the league and the city of
      Cleveland, Modell was required to leave the Browns'' history and records in
      Cleveland for a replacement team and replacement personnel that would take control
      in 1999. In return, he was allowed to take his own personnel and team to Baltimore,
      where such personnel would then form an expansion team.'

      standards for right and wrong behavior, and from meta-ethics, which concerns
      the nature of ethical properties, statements, attitudes, and judgments.[7]

    description: 'In modern archery, a compound bow is a bow that uses a levering
      system, usually of cables and pulleys, to bend the limbs.[1]


      The pulley/cam system grants the user a mechanical advantage, and so the limbs
      of a compound bow are much stiffer than those of a recurve bow or longbow. This
      rigidity makes the compound bow more energy-efficient than other bows, as less
      energy is dissipated in limb movement. The higher-rigidity, higher-technology
      construction also improves accuracy by reducing the bow''s sensitivity to changes
      in temperature and humidity.


      The pulley/cam system also confers a benefit called "let-off". As the string
      is drawn back, the pulleys rotate. The pulleys are eccentric rather than round,
      and so their effective radius changes as they rotate. The pulleys feature two
      cam tracks. An inner cam track which connects mechanically to the limbs or opposite
      cam and an outer cam track which the bowstring runs through. As the bow is drawn
      the ratio of bowstring pay-out and bowstring take-up relative to limb-weight
      and leverage of the cams changes. By manipulation of the shapes of these cam
      tracks, different draw-stroke profiles can be created. A compound bow can be
      soft-drawing with a slow build-up to peak weight and a gradual let-off with
      a long "valley" at the end. It can also be hard-drawing with a very fast build-up
      to peak draw-weight, a long plateau where weight is maintained, and a quick
      let-off with a short valley. The let-off itself is the result of the cam profiles
      having passed center and approaching a condition very similar to a cam-lock.
      In fact some compound bows, if the draw-stops or draw-length modules are removed,
      will self-lock at full draw and require professional equipment to unlock safely.'
    description_short: The compound bow was first developed in 1966; the compound
      bow is the dominant form of bow.

    description: 'A ruby is a pink to blood-red colored gemstone, a variety of the
      mineral corundum (aluminium oxide). Other varieties of gem-quality corundum
      are called sapphires. Ruby is one of the traditional cardinal gems, together
      with amethyst, sapphire, emerald, and diamond.[3] The word ruby comes from ruber,
      Latin for red. The color of a ruby is due to the element chromium.


      The quality of a ruby is determined by its color, cut, and clarity, which, along
      with carat weight, affect its value. The brightest and most valuable shade of
      red called blood-red or pigeon blood, commands a large premium over other rubies
      of similar quality. After color follows clarity: similar to diamonds, a clear
      stone will command a premium, but a ruby without any needle-like rutile inclusions
      may indicate that the stone has been treated. Ruby is the traditional birthstone
      for July and is usually more pink than garnet, although some rhodolite garnets
      have a similar pinkish hue to most rubies. The world''s most expensive ruby
      is the Sunrise Ruby.'

    description: "Diamond ( /\u02C8da\u026A\u0259m\u0259nd/ or /\u02C8da\u026Am\u0259\
      nd/) is a metastable allotrope of carbon, where the carbon atoms are arranged\
      \ in a variation of the face-centered cubic crystal structure called a diamond\
      \ lattice. Diamond is less stable than graphite, but the conversion rate from\
      \ diamond to graphite is negligible at standard conditions. Diamond is renowned\
      \ as a material with superlative physical qualities, most of which originate\
      \ from the strong covalent bonding between its atoms. In particular, diamond\
      \ has the highest hardness and thermal conductivity of any bulk material. Those\
      \ properties determine the major industrial application of diamond in cutting\
      \ and polishing tools and the scientific applications in diamond knives and\
      \ diamond anvil cells.\n\nBecause of its extremely rigid lattice, it can be\
      \ contaminated by very few types of impurities, such as boron and nitrogen.\
      \ Small amounts of defects or impurities (about one per million of lattice atoms)\
      \ color diamond blue (boron), yellow (nitrogen), brown (lattice defects), green\
      \ (radiation exposure), purple, pink, orange or red. Diamond also has relatively\
      \ high optical dispersion (ability to disperse light of different colors).\n\
      \nMost natural diamonds are formed at high temperature and pressure at depths\
      \ of 140 to 190 kilometers (87 to 118 mi) in the Earth's mantle. Carbon-containing\
      \ minerals provide the carbon source, and the growth occurs over periods from\
      \ 1 billion to 3.3 billion years (25% to 75% of the age of the Earth). Diamonds\
      \ are brought close to the Earth's surface through deep volcanic eruptions by\
      \ magma, which cools into igneous rocks known as kimberlites and lamproites.\
      \ Diamonds can also be produced synthetically in a HPHT method which approximately\
      \ simulates the conditions in the Earth's mantle. An alternative, and completely\
      \ different growth technique is chemical vapor deposition (CVD). Several non-diamond\
      \ materials, which include cubic zirconia and silicon carbide and are often\
      \ called diamond simulants, resemble diamond in appearance and many properties.\
      \ Special gemological techniques have been developed to distinguish natural\
      \ diamonds, synthetic diamonds, and diamond simulants. The word is from the\
      \ ancient Greek \u1F00\u03B4\u03AC\u03BC\u03B1\u03C2 \u2013 ad\xE1mas \"unbreakable\"\

    description: 'A motorcycle helmet is a type of helmet used by motorcycle riders.
      The primary goal of a motorcycle helmet is motorcycle safety - to protect the
      rider''s head during impact, thus preventing or reducing head injury and saving
      the rider''s life. Some helmets provide additional conveniences, such as ventilation,
      face shields, ear protection, intercom etc.


      Motorcyclists are at high risk in traffic crashes. A 2008 systematic review[1]
      examined studies on motorcycle riders who had crashed and looked at helmet use
      as an intervention. The review concluded that helmets reduce the risk of head
      injury by around 69% and death by around 42%. Although it was once speculated
      that wearing a motorcycle helmet increased neck and spinal injuries in a crash,
      recent evidence has shown the opposite to be the case, that helmets protect
      against cervical spine injury, and that an often-cited small study dating to
      the mid-1980s, "used flawed statistical reasoning".'

    description: 'The Komodo dragon[4] (Varanus komodoensis), also known as the Komodo
      monitor, is a large species of lizard found in the Indonesian islands of Komodo,
      Rinca, Flores, Gili Motang, and Padar.[5] A member of the monitor lizard family
      Varanidae, it is the largest living species of lizard, growing to a maximum
      length of 3 metres (10 ft) in rare cases and weighing up to approximately 70
      kilograms (150 lb).[5]


      Their unusually large size has been attributed to island gigantism, since no
      other carnivorous animals fill the niche on the islands where they live.[6][7]
      However, recent research suggests the large size of Komodo dragons may be better
      understood as representative of a relict population of very large varanid lizards
      that once lived across Indonesia and Australia, most of which, along with other
      megafauna,[1] died out after the Pleistocene. Fossils very similar to V. komodoensis
      have been found in Australia dating to greater than 3.8 million years ago, and
      its body size remained stable on Flores, one of the handful of Indonesian islands
      where it is currently found, over the last 900,000 years, "a time marked by
      major faunal turnovers, extinction of the island''s megafauna, and the arrival
      of early hominids by 880 ka [kiloannums]."[1]


      As a result of their size, these lizards dominate the ecosystems in which they
      live.[8] Komodo dragons hunt and ambush prey including invertebrates, birds,
      and mammals. It has been claimed that they have a venomous bite; there are two
      glands in the lower jaw which secrete several toxic proteins. The biological
      significance of these proteins is disputed, but the glands have been shown to
      secrete an anticoagulant. Komodo dragon group behaviour in hunting is exceptional
      in the reptile world. The diet of big Komodo dragons mainly consists of deer,
      though they also eat considerable amounts of carrion.[5] Komodo dragons also
      occasionally attack humans.[9]


      Mating begins between May and August, and the eggs are laid in September. About
      20 eggs are deposited in abandoned megapode nests or in a self-dug nesting hole.[5]
      The eggs are incubated for seven to eight months, hatching in April, when insects
      are most plentiful. Young Komodo dragons are vulnerable and therefore dwell
      in trees, safe from predators and cannibalistic adults. They take 8 to 9 years
      to mature, and are estimated to live up to 30 years.[5]


      Komodo dragons were first recorded by Western scientists in 1910.[10] Their
      large size and fearsome reputation make them popular zoo exhibits. In the wild,
      their range has contracted due to human activities, and they are listed as vulnerable
      by the IUCN.[2] They are protected under Indonesian law, and a national park,
      Komodo National Park, was founded to aid protection efforts.'

      hobbyists were able to purchase them and use astrological or astronomical calculation
      software or make such programs themselves. Astrologer and computer programmer
      Michael Erlewine was involved early in making astrological software for microcomputers
      available to the general public in the late 1970s. In 1978, Erlewine founded
      Matrix Software, and in 1980 he published a book with all the algorithms and
      data required for owners of microcomputers to make their own complete astrological
      programs.[5] At first, astrology software was opposed by American astrologers
      who did not approve of computers in their field. However, acceptance grew as
      it became clear how more efficient and profitable such software could be.[5]


      A few hundred fixed-purpose astrology computers were made, one of which was
      used by Nancy Reagan''s astrologer beginning in about 1981'

    description: 'In audio, a mixing console is an electronic device for combining
      (also called "mixing"), routing, and changing the volume level, timbre (tone
      color) and/or dynamics of many different audio signals, such as microphones
      being used by singers, mics picking up acoustic instruments such as drums or
      saxophones, signals from electric or electronic instruments such as the electric
      bass or synthesizer, or recorded music playing on a CD player. In the 2010s,
      a mixer is able to control analog or digital signals, depending on the type
      of mixer. The modified signals (voltages or digital samples) are summed to produce
      the combined output signals, which can then be broadcast, amplified through
      a sound reinforcement system or recorded (or some combination of these applications).


      Mixing consoles are used in many applications, including recording studios,
      public address systems, sound reinforcement systems, nightclubs, dance clubs,
      broadcasting, television, and film post-production. A typical, simple application
      combines signals from two microphones (each used by vocalists singing a duet,
      perhaps) into an amplifier that drives one set of speakers simultaneously. In
      live performances, the signal from the mixer usually goes directly to an amplifier
      which is plugged into speaker cabinets, unless the mixer has a built-in power
      amplifier or is connected to powered speakers. A DJ mixer may have only two
      channels, for mixing two record players. A coffeehouse''s tiny stage might only
      have a six channel mixer, enough for two singer-guitarists and a percussionist.
      A nightclub stage''s mixer for rock music shows may have 24 channels for mixing
      the signals from a rhythm section, lead guitar and several vocalists. A mixing
      console for a large concert may have 48 channels. A mixing console in a professional
      recording studio may have as many as 96 channels.'

      structures as speech, such as vocabulary, grammar, and semantics, with the added
      dependency of a system of signs or symbols. The result of writing is called
      text, and the recipient of text is called a reader. Motivations for writing
      include publication, storytelling, correspondence and diary. Writing has been
      instrumental in keeping history, maintaining culture, dissemination of knowledge
      through the media and the formation of legal systems.
